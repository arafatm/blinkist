## Introduction

What’s in it for me? A riveting, whirlwind tour through the universe.

The universe is 13.8 billion years old. Imagine this stretch of time as being
equivalent to the length of a football field. On it, every step you take is
equivalent to about 50 million years. Where do you think the entire span of
human history fits in?

Right at the end . . . about the width of a single human hair.

We humans tend to feel like we’re important. In reality, we occupy a humble
corner of an unassuming galaxy in a completely average stretch of space and
time.

Lucky for you, this Blink takes you on a trip far beyond the rock we call home.
As we fly through the astrophysical classic, Welcome to the Universe, written
by preeminent astronomers Neil deGrass Tyson, Michael A. Strauss, and J.
Richard Gott, we’ll be visiting stars, galaxies, black holes, and even do a bit
of time traveling –⁠ so, if you’re ready, strap in, and get ready for
lift-off!

In this Blink, you’ll learn
- why Pluto isn’t a planet;
- what lies at the center of every galaxy; and
- how you can travel back in time to shake your own hand.

## Getting situated.

Okay, first stop. Lower Earth orbit.

Before heading out any further, we need to get you situated with our starting
point – Earth. Our little blue marble of life. For many of you, this will seem
like your very first trip to space. But in reality, you’ve been rocketing
through space all your lives. Because, realize it or not, we’re all living on a
rock moving roughly 100,000 kilometers per hour through our solar system. And
in that sense, Earth already is a kind of spaceship.

Now, looking at Earth from space, I’m going to ask that everyone tilt their
heads just slightly to the right. That’s it. It’s only now that you’re actually
looking at our planet head-on. This is because as Earth orbits the sun, it’s
perpetually tilted at an angle of 23.5°. As we orbit the sun once a year, Earth
keeps a constant tilt, maintaining the exact same orientation for the entire
journey.

Alright, now look toward the edges of Earth. See that creeping shadow? Well as
you might have guessed, that’s the night beginning for those parts of Earth.
But, what you might not realize, unless you’re looking at Earth head-on, is
that it’s always exactly 50 percent covered in sunlight and exactly 50 percent
in darkness. Forget daylight saving time, long winters, summer solstices,
that’s just where you happen to be located on this tilt. People in Antarctica
can see daylight for 24 hours in December . . . but Earth as a whole? Without
exception, it’s always 50/50.

And it’s this very tilt that dictates everything we know about the sky. From
the stars we see, to the path of the sun. Many people believe that high noon
means the sun is directly overhead. But, in fact, if you’re looking from the
US, you’ll never, at no point of day or year, experience the sun directly over
your head. It just doesn’t happen. Because in the US, you’re always witnessing
the sun at an angle. This also means you’ll never see all the same star
constellations that the Southern Hemisphere does, and vice versa.

So, if you can all untilt your necks . . . now we’re situated and looking
straight ahead. It’s time to start our tour through space at our solar system’s
crown jewel – the sun.

## The sun.

There it is, the sun!

From Earth, it might appear as yellow, but in reality, it’s radiating roughly
equal amounts of all the visible colors, which instead gives us white light,
not yellow. But burning away somewhere around 6,000 degrees K – it’s quite a
bit hotter than your normal white flame.

A cooler star than the sun –⁠ say with a temperature of only 1,000 K
–⁠ looks red, because it emits more low-energy red light than high-energy
blue light. That’s why, when you look at the other end of the heat spectrum,
say at a really hot star of 30,000 K – it appears as a rich blue color.

But, whether hot or cool, every star contains a kind of thermonuclear hydrogen
furnace at its core. And the hotter they burn, the faster they run through
their hydrogen supply. That’s why the bluest, hottest stars die quicker than
others – only lasting for about 10 million years. While a cooler star, like the
sun, will have a slow burn – living for a total of 10 billion years. The cooler
the temperature, the longer the lifespan.

Now if we were able to crack open the sun and look directly into the middle –
we’d see a glowing core smack-dab in the center. That’s the thermonuclear
furnace we were talking about. It not only keeps the center of a star hot, but
also performs another amazing function: generating elements. Because it’s so
hot in there, the normal rules of electromagnetism cease to apply, and the
hydrogen protons attract instead of repelling each other. And when protons
attract, they collide. Thus forming new forms of matter.

At the center of our sun, four million tons of matter are converted into energy
every second. And it’s almost entirely Hydrogen fusing to become Helium. This
process continues for about 90 percent of a star’s lifetime – creating energy
from hydrogen and keeping the core hot and stable. But eventually, and we’re
talking like five billion years from now, the hydrogen fuel at the sun’s core
will begin to run out, shifting to a largely Helium core. And this is where
things will get out of hand, pretty quickly. With no hydrogen, the core will
grow increasingly unstable and begin to collapse – becoming hotter and hotter
as it burns through any leftover hydrogen in the outer layers. As a result, the
sun’s envelope will expand, and it will become what we call a red giant. It
looks exactly how it sounds, red . . . and giant.

As the red giant continues to grow, the core gets hotter and helium begins
fusing to become carbon. Carbon then becomes oxygen. Until eventually, the core
builds up what looks like something resembling an onion, layered with all these
different elements.

But as these layers continue to grow and expand, the whole star will inevitably
burn out, collapse, and throw off its gaseous envelope, releasing all of its
stellar guts into the galaxy. This is where the sun will end – resting into its
final stage as a humble white dwarf.

For bigger stars, this can result in a reaction so massive it explodes into a
supernova, in turn collapsing into a neutron star or even a black hole!

Earth, of course, will become a charred ember long before any of this happens.
In a mere one billion years, our sun will already have grown large enough to
cause Earth’s oceans to boil and evaporate into the atmosphere, and life as we
know it will cease to exist . . .

And on this happy note, it’s time to take a quick tour of the rest of our solar
system while we still can!

## Our solar system.

The enriched gases that explode from a star after its life has ended can
eventually form into balls of solid matter containing elements like oxygen,
silicon, and iron. In other words: terrestrial planets. In our solar system, we
have nine – shoot – I mean, eight planets . . . I’ll get to that miscount
momentarily. But first, look outside your windows and you’ll find yourselves
passing the first family of planets that our wonderful solar system has to
offer.

Those would be Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars. All of them are small and rocky
objects that orbit the sun. They certainly have many differences, but they’re
still closer to each other than they are to anything else in the solar system.

Now take a look to your right, and you will see the next family in the solar
system –⁠ collectively known as the gas giants. These are Jupiter, Saturn,
Uranus, and Neptune. Again, these planets are certainly very different from one
another, but they all share the traits of being big and low-density.

Then there’s everyone’s favorite problem child: Pluto. Is it a planet or not?
You may have already taken a side when it comes to this controversy.

No offense to Pluto, but it just doesn’t fit in with either of the two other
families of planets. First of all, its orbit is all wrong –⁠ it crosses
with Neptune’s, which isn’t at all how a planet should behave. Plus, its orbit
is at an angle relative to the plane of all the other planets. That’s another
strike against it. 

Since 1992, scientists have found over a thousand objects like Pluto –⁠
icy bodies beyond Neptune, many with orbits similar to Pluto’s. Together, these
small, icy bodies make up what we call the Kuiper Belt. These are Pluto’s true
brothers and sisters. Pluto just happens to be the biggest and brightest one of
them all.

I’ve noticed one or two of you have taken out the stellar blankets provided for
you. You’ve likely noticed that the universe is no stranger to very cool
temperatures. As a whole, the universe has a temperature left over from the big
bang, when all the matter in the universe was condensed and then rapidly
expanded. Right now, it’s at 2.7 K⁠ –⁠ and dropping. The data shows
that the universe is going to keep expanding, steadily approaching 0 K, or
absolute zero. One by one, the stars will use up all their fuel, dying out and
disappearing from the sky until every last light goes out.

## Light and distance.

As we start to head outside of our own solar system, you’ll notice that
everywhere you turn the sky is full of bright, shining stars.

It’s very likely that you have quite a few misconceptions about them, though.
For example, you’ve probably heard it repeated that the North Star –⁠
Polaris –⁠ is the brightest in the sky. That’s actually incorrect. In
fact, Polaris isn’t even in the top ten . . . or 20 . . . or 30 brightest
stars. It comes in at a lowly 45th place. The brightest is actually Sirius,
otherwise known as the Dog Star.

And as we start to speed up, this might be a good time to wrap our heads around
distances. Take our sun for example. Even though the sun is close to Earth,
it’s not exactly close. The sun is 150 million kilometers away. But we don’t
typically measure the distance in kilometers or miles. Instead, we use the
amount of time it takes light to travel the distance. The speed of light is
300,000 kilometers per second. The distance from the sun to Earth is about
eight light-minutes –⁠ so, in other words, it takes light eight minutes to
travel that distance.

For comparison, the stars in the system known as Alpha Centauri –⁠ our
“nearest” neighbors –⁠ are about four light-years away. This means that
the light we see from those stars was actually emitted four years ago. Any time
we gaze out into the universe, we’re looking back in time!

But on that note, what are we even looking at when we look at the stars? What
is light? Well, it consists of photons, which are simultaneously particles and
waves. The amount of energy they can carry differs, which creates different
“flavors” of photons.

One of the photon flavors is visible light, to which the human eye is sensitive
–⁠ white, red, orange, yellow, green, blue, and violet light. Then there
are the flavors that our eyes are not sensitive to. These include infrared
light, microwaves, and radio waves, which are all “below” red on the light
spectrum. And then there’s ultraviolet light, X-rays, and gamma rays “above”
violet on the spectrum.

As you move along the spectrum up toward gamma rays, the energy contained in
each photon increases. There’s a reason everyone tells you to wear sunscreen to
protect yourself from UV rays and why you need to wear a lead blanket while
getting an X-ray!

We’ve still only scratched the surface when it comes to stars. To see even
more, we’ll have to go much further than we are now. Hold on tight.

## Nebulas, galaxies, and dark matter.

As we begin to dart through the Milky Way galaxy, you’ll notice stars aren’t
lone wolves. Instead, they form in clusters.

Some clusters contain just a few hundred stars. In that case, we call them open
clusters. Others have hundreds of thousands of stars, in which case we call
them globular clusters. In both cases, the stars in any given cluster share a
birthday –⁠ they all formed from a gas cloud at the same time.

The Pleiades, which you can see ahead, is an open cluster probably less than
100 million years old. It’s full of young, bright, blue stars –⁠ which, if
you remember, means they’re incredibly hot. But there are also some cooler, red
stars nearby. There’s no reason to believe this isn’t just a coincidence. Some
stars start out hot, others cool –⁠ they’re born that way!

Next up, you’ll find that we’re now passing the Orion Nebula. This clump of gas
and dust particles lies within our own galaxy, and it’s a veritable stellar
nursery. About 700 stars are in the process of being born here right now!

Nebulas like this one are enriched with heavy elements previously formed in the
inner cores of dying stars. Gravity always works to pull the gas and dust
together and create something out of it. So, just like we learned how leftover
elements can sometimes become new planetary systems, they can also become new
stars! But when this happens, as the material is pulled inward, it heats up.
Eventually, it gets so hot and dense that thermonuclear reactions begin to take
place –⁠ and boom, you have a newborn star.

The Milky Way contains roughly one to three hundred billion stars. They’re
arranged in a flattened disk with a total diameter of about 100,000
light-years. At the center, there’s a thicker, lumpier distribution of stars
about 20,000 light-years long. This is called the bulge. Star formation occurs
almost exclusively in the disk-like spiral arms that radiate out from the
bulge.

And there’s something else going on in the arms, too. The mass of the Milky
Way, which we’ve been able to calculate, isn’t matched by the number of stars
we can observe. This has led scientists to postulate the existence of dark
matter which contributes to the mass of the universe. In fact, we now think
that the vast majority of the Milky Way’s mass exists in the form of dark
matter, even though we haven’t yet been able to observe it directly or identify
the elementary particles from which it’s made.

Dark matter is interesting enough but equally fascinating is what lies at the
center of the Milky Way. The stars at the very center are orbiting something
–⁠ an invisible, extremely massive something, 4 million times the mass of
the sun. Can you guess what it is? We’ll talk about it –⁠ and its brethren
–⁠ next.

## Black holes.

Objects so massive that not even light can escape them –⁠ these are what
lie at the center of galaxies. We’re talking, of course, about black holes.

At the very center of every large galaxy with a significant bulge, there lies a
supermassive black hole. That includes the Milky Way. But actually, in
comparison, ours is kind of on the wimpy side. Our black hole has a mass of
just 4 million suns, while others are worth several billion suns.

Black holes are truly fascinating objects. Unfortunately, we can’t exactly
travel to one and see what happens inside. Why? Well, think about what happens
when you throw a ball up in the air on Earth. Normally, it goes up and then
comes down. But if you threw the ball up fast enough, it would escape Earth’s
gravitational field, never to return. Here, “fast enough” would mean a speed of
25,000 miles per hour –⁠ that’s Earth’s escape velocity or the speed at
which something must travel to escape its gravitational field.

Black holes are so compact and so dense that they have an escape velocity
greater than the speed of light. Because of that, not even light can travel
fast enough to escape them. Now, you may be wondering: what would happen to you
if you were to try vacationing inside a black hole?

Well, as long as you stayed outside a certain radius of the black hole,
everything would be just fine. Even inside the black hole, you wouldn’t die
immediately. In fact, things would only start to get ugly once you crossed
something called the Schwarzschild radius, otherwise known as the event
horizon. This is the point at which the escape velocity of the black hole
exceeds the speed of light. Once you crossed that radius, it would be game
over. Except that the event horizon of a black hole is completely invisible, so
you’d never even know when you crossed it. You could even be crossing the
Schwarzschild radius of some massive black hole right now, none the wiser!

After crossing the Schwarzschild radius, as you traveled further and further
into the black hole, your body would begin to get stretched. If you were
falling feet first, your feet would be pulled downward by the mass at the
center of the black hole. Meanwhile, your left and right shoulders would be
drawn inward toward the center. You’d slowly be crushed from both sides while
being stretched –⁠ like getting turned into a piece of spaghetti. And what
do you know? The real, technical term for this process is spaghettification.
And no, I’m not kidding!

Fortunately, death by spaghettification is pretty quick, taking just 0.09
seconds in a 3-billion-solar-mass black hole. But we can never actually observe
this process happening directly. No outside observer can witness anything that
occurs beyond the event horizon of a black hole, in the same way that you can’t
see past the horizon from anywhere you stand on Earth.

## The shape of the universe.

If you recall, we dipped our toes into the topic of the big bang earlier on our
tour. We briefly discussed the explosion of matter that resulted in the
universe we know today –⁠ a universe that will die when all its energy has
been used up.

The big bang model makes several predictions. As scientists, we compare those
predictions with what we observe. The results we find show us how accurate the
predictions are. And so far, the big bang model has passed every test we’ve
thrown at it.

One such prediction is that the universe should be expanding –⁠ and that’s
exactly what it’s doing.

In a way, the universe is like a loaf of raisin bread. The galaxies are like
the raisins, while the dough is the space between them. The dough starts at the
big bang, in a highly compressed state, with all the raisins close together.

As the dough expands in the oven, the raisins move farther and farther away
from one another. From each individual raisin’s perspective, all the other
raisins are receding away from it. Similarly, from our vantage point in the
Milky Way, all other galaxies appear to be moving away from us –⁠ even
though in reality, we’re also moving. Furthermore, more distant raisins, or
galaxies, appear to be receding twice as fast as the closer raisins, because
there’s twice as much expanding dough in between.

This analogy isn’t perfect, because a loaf of raisin bread isn’t infinite and
has edges, unlike the universe. But, just as in the raisin bread, the raisins
themselves –⁠ meaning the galaxies –⁠ aren’t expanding. Only the
space in between them is.

But if the universe isn’t shaped like a loaf of bread. What is its shape?

The key to this question lies in understanding how many dimensions the universe
has. The answer is four. That’s because you need four coordinates in order to
pinpoint any event –⁠ three dimensions of space and one dimension of time.
Given these four dimensions, you might represent the universe as a diagram in
the shape of an American football, just as physicist Alexander Friedmann did
back in 1922.

In Friedmann’s diagram, time starts at the point at the very bottom of the
football, with the big bang, and ends at the very top. At the big bang, the
galaxies all fly away from each other until the point of maximum expansion in
the middle of the football. We haven’t yet reached this point in time, because,
as we’ve confirmed, the universe is still expanding.

After the point of maximum expansion in Friedmann’s model, galaxies begin
moving back toward each other. The distances eventually shrink until they all
crash back together again at what is known as the big crunch.

This model of the universe is just one potential way of looking at things.
Nothing states that it must take the shape of an American football. The
universe could also, for instance, look something like a Victorian woman’s
corset. But whatever shape you choose the universe to have, it’s now time to
turn to one of my favorite topics: time travel.

## Time travel and wormholes.

Time travel as depicted in most science fiction has one major flaw. In order to return to the past via a time machine, according to Einstein, a time traveler must be able to exceed the speed of light. But we know that traveling faster than light is physically impossible.

However, nothing says you can’t take a shortcut to beat light to the finish line. There are two ways of doing that: going through a wormhole or around a cosmic string.

Wormholes are short tunnels connecting two distant points in curved spacetime. There are a few different types of wormholes that can exist. One lies within black holes. These can theoretically connect two different universes, like two funnels taped together. The wormhole is like the center point connecting the two narrow ends of the funnels.

You can’t pass through these types of wormholes because you’d be required to travel at the speed of light. Other wormholes, however, are traversable. We haven’t yet discovered any of these, but they are theoretically possible.

Here’s how it could work. One end of the tunnel might be somewhere near Earth, while the other end could be four light-years away, at the star system Alpha Centauri. But the wormhole tunnel itself is only ten feet long.

You can think about the wormhole as a dinner table with a hole drilled through it. Say there are some ants at the top, trying to get to the underside. They could go the long way, running along the top, over the edge, and onto the bottom. Or they could travel by wormhole, popping into the hole in the table and immediately finding themselves on the bottom. You aren’t breaking any of the laws of physics here –⁠ you’re just taking a shortcut.

The time travel aspect comes in when you pull the wormhole gravitationally –⁠ perhaps with a giant spaceship. Say that, as in our previous example, one mouth of the wormhole is near Earth and the other is near Alpha Centauri. If, on January 1st, 3000, you use the spaceship to gravitationally pull one wormhole mouth on a 5-year round-trip journey at 99.5 percent of the speed of light, people on Earth would see it return just over five years later. Inside the wormhole tunnel itself, however, time would be moving ten times slower since it’s traveling at almost the speed of light –⁠ so instead of five years, only six months would have passed inside the wormhole, and therefore also on the Alpha Centauri side. So, if you jumped into the wormhole's mouth upon its return to Earth on January 10, 3005, you would reach Alpha Centauri on July 1, 3000, four and a half years earlier. Then, because Alpha Centauri is only four light-years away through ordinary space, if you get in a spaceship and travel back to Earth at 99.5 percent of the speed of light, you’ll return in a little over four years. And as a result, you’d likely arrive back on Earth on July 8, 3004 –⁠ six months before you jumped through the wormhole to begin with. Just in time to shake your own hand and wish yourself luck on your own journey!

Now, what about time-traveling by cosmic string? A cosmic string is an extremely thin thread – thinner than an atomic nucleus – that is highly energy-dense. These strings have no ends and are made of energy left over from the early universe. They can either be infinite in extent or occur in closed loops –⁠ like strands of spaghetti and SpaghettiOs. 

But these cosmic strings are no small fries. They’re expected to be extremely massive –⁠ about a million-billion tons per centimeter.

Theoretically, a person could also use the warping of spacetime caused by strings in order to time travel. But this could only happen if two strings got close enough for you to circle them. If the strings were far apart, it would take too long to circle them –⁠ too long to get back to your own past. In practice, you’re very unlikely to get so lucky to come across two cosmic strings passing each other in such a way to make a time machine.

Fleshing out all these complicated theories about time travel requires much more information about quantum mechanics. Most importantly, we must marry general relativity and quantum mechanics such that we can understand whether it really is possible to construct a time machine and visit the past. Perhaps some laws of physics we discover one day will teach us it’s impossible. But for now, the door –⁠ or perhaps the wormhole –⁠ is still open.

## Life outside our solar system.

We’ve been exploring the universe for a while now. How’s everyone feeling?

By this point, you have a solid grasp of the physical material that makes up the universe, as well as some more theoretical concepts. But we’ve saved the best for last: the question of whether there is intelligent life in the universe aside from humanity.

Life as we know it requires a few things in order to exist. Number one on the list is liquid water. If your planet is too close to a star like the sun, the water evaporates. Too far away and it freezes.

Of course, the situation is far more complicated than that. Different stars have different luminosities, which means they have habitable zones of different sizes. And, based on everything we know, you need a planet orbiting a star in order to have life. You also need enough time –⁠ time for the star to be created, then the planet, and then billions of years for life to have a chance to evolve. That means the star has to be long-lived. The most massive stars only live for about 10 million years, which makes life near one of those pretty hopeless.

That’s already quite a few requirements. But there are a lot more! That’s especially true if we’re talking about life with which we might be able to converse –⁠ intelligent life. Even that, though, isn’t enough. You also need that intelligent life form to be able to send signals across incredibly long distances in space, and for us to have caught the life form at the right moment in its history. If an intelligent life form is even just 1,000 light-years away, it had to have been transmitting signals across space 1,000 years ago in order for its signals to be reaching us now.

We could go on. But perhaps it’s better, for the last stop on this journey, to take you to one of our most promising candidates where there could be life.

That candidate is called Kepler 62e. Its radius is 1.61 times as large as Earth’s, and it only receives 20 percent more radiation per square meter from its star –⁠ Kepler 62 –⁠ than we do from the sun. That makes it pretty likely to lie in a habitable zone. Kepler 62e could be either rocky or icy with an ocean –⁠ we aren’t really sure.

That’s a concrete example –⁠ now, let’s think about the question numerically. Luckily, a certain astrophysicist called Frank Drake has already helped us out here. He came up with something we now know as the Drake equation, which helps us estimate the number of potentially life-supporting planets in our galaxy.

The Drake equation looks into the fraction of suitable stars with a planet in the habitable zone. So, consider a spherical region of space, with a radius of 40 light-years. Within that sphere, you’ll have something like 1,000 stars. Using the Drake equation under our specific perimeters, you’ll likely find an average of six habitable planets within this radius alone. And remember –⁠ 40 light-years is tiny in comparison to the expanse of the entire galaxy, not to mention the entire universe!

The next part of the equation involves calculating the number of planets that have developed a technology capable of communicating across interstellar distances –⁠ and which are communicating during the epoch at which we’re observing them now. The chance of catching a planet during that specific phase at a random time is equivalent to the average longevity of radio-transmitting civilizations divided by the age of the galaxy. And that’s where things get complicated because we only have one example of an intelligent civilization: our own. One estimate suggests that the average lifespan of a radio-transmitting civilization is likely to be 12,000 years, though of course there are other possibilities.

Plug the numbers into the Drake equation, and voilà, you’re left with an estimated number of communicating civilizations! There are many different interpretations out there on exactly what measurements are best to plug into the Drake equation, but for fun, the authors of this book threw in their best estimates and found that there could be up to a hundred civilizations in the Milky Way galaxy capable of communicating with radio waves currently. However, as of right now, we haven’t found any of these . . .⁠ and it doesn’t seem like they’ve found us. All that remains is to keep on searching!

## Final Summary

The universe is so much bigger, hotter, denser, and weirder than we typically
realize. It can be easy to convince ourselves that Earth is somehow special,
but in reality, we and our planet occupy a corner of space that’s not much
different from any other. Stars, planets, galaxies, black holes, wormholes
–⁠ these are just a few of the things that exist, or may exist, in the
vast expanse of the universe. And as we grow along with our universe, we
continue to discover new things about space, time, and our very existence every
day.
