(2018) casts a critical eye on our modern world through the lens of evolutionary psychology. This provocative text argues that human nature is the product of generations spent struggling to survive on the savannah and that many of our contemporary problems can be understood by looking backward.


# What’s in it for me? Another approach to understanding human behavior.

How would you describe human nature? Are we kind and forgiving, or are we cruel and vengeful? Do we have altruistic impulses, or are we merely selfish and stingy? The truth is, all of the above. Humans are complex creatures. 

So, where do all these habits and hang-ups come from? Well, all those wholesome, horrible, and downright weird qualities that make us human were forged through thousands of years of evolution. Specifically, key facets of human nature emerged during our ancestors’ transition from living in forests to living on the African savannah.

These blinks detail how this critical phase in human history has left a permanent impression on how we think, act, and relate to each other. Drawing on in-depth research from the fields of biology, psychology, and social science, they show how an evolutionary lens can help us understand even the most counterintuitive aspects of our modern culture.

In these blinks, you’ll learn

- why children don’t bring happiness;
- how much a chimp’s brain weighs; and
- what farming has to do with inequality.

# Conditions on the savannah forced our ancestors to evolve a more social lifestyle.

It’s six or seven million years ago and you’re a chimpanzee-like ape living in the lush rainforests of central Africa. Up in the forest canopy, food is plentiful, predators are rare, and life is easy. Unfortunately, all that is about to change.

Over the next million years, climate change and tectonic shifts will erode your verdant jungle habitat. While you get to live in the trees, your descendants will have to scrape by on the open grasslands of the savannah. Down there, there’s less to eat and a lot more hyenas and sabertooth tigers to watch out for. 

Life isn’t so easy anymore. If your species wants to endure, it will have to adopt a whole new set of survival strategies.

**The key message here is: Conditions on the savannah forced our ancestors to evolve a more social lifestyle.**

Our chimp-like ancestors most likely didn’t move to the savannah by choice. After all, compared to life in the trees, eking out an existence on the ground is much more difficult. For one, the vast, relatively sparse fields of the steppe meant pre-humans had to travel farther to gather food. Worse still, all that open space provided little protection from predators.

These new conditions put pressure on our ancestors. The only way to survive was to adapt. For instance, **Australopithecus afarensis**, a species of ape which emerged three million years ago, is notable for having developed narrower hips to aid bipedal walking, and for having more mobile shoulders and wrists to enable throwing. These changes made it possible to move more quickly and also to throw stones – a crucial skill for warding off large predators.

However, while one ape throwing stones is good, many apes throwing stones is even better. For this reason, the most important adaptation our ancestors evolved was the ability to work cooperatively. Just think, almost every survival strategy – from hunting and watching out for enemies to raising young – becomes much more effective when done in groups.

Of course, working together in an interdependent group isn’t easy. Effective coordination requires communication skills, emotional intelligence, and other new mental capacities we take for granted today. Thus, in order to survive, early hominids had to make a “social leap” by evolving bigger brains and honing their interpersonal abilities.

In the next blink, we’ll take a closer look at how our cognitive capacities grew from this evolutionary pressure.

# 

“**When our ancestors chanced upon a social solution to the challenges of life on the savannah they set in place a cascade of events that eventually led to our human origins.**”

# Our cognitive abilities compounded with each successive generation.

Here’s a question: If the average chimpanzee’s brain weighs about 380 grams, how much do you think a normal human brain weighs? 500 grams? 800 grams? Nope. Plop an average human cranium on a scale and it will weigh in at 1,350 grams. Quite the difference. 

So, what accounts for this stark divide in brainpower? About six million years of evolution. You see, while a chimp’s ancestors stayed in the trees, ours spent several thousand generations adapting to life on the ground. 

Along the way, environmental pressures encouraged us to evolve bigger brains with sharper social skills. Those sharper skills helped us develop more complex societies. And, in turn, those complex societies pushed us to evolve even stronger social skills. 

**Here’s the key message: Our cognitive abilities compounded with each successive generation.**

Modern humans are a species of ape called **Homo sapiens**. We first emerged in Africa about 200,000 years ago. However, we can trace our roots much further back through a successive line of earlier hominid species. Looking into the past, it’s clear that our success as a species closely correlates with a growth in cognitive abilities and social coordination. 

Compare two early hominid species, **Australopithecus afarensis**, which evolved three million years ago, and **Homo erectus**, which came a million years later. While **afarensis **was moderately successful in Africa, **erectus** managed to successfully spread much further into Europe and Asia. 

The key difference?** Erectus**’s brain is about twice the size of **afarensis**. This cognitive advantage allowed for a more complex social life. Archeological evidence suggests that **erectus** could divide labor within a tribe to produce better, more sophisticated tools, then use them to carry out complex hunting plans. In fact, skeletal remains show that **erectus **was even able to hunt and butcher entire elephants. 

With this increased hunting capacity, our ancestors could take in enough nutrients to sustain larger brains. With these larger brains, they could build better tools, and, even more importantly, be better teachers. As **homo erectus** evolved into **homo sapiens**, our brains further developed the ability to imagine the thoughts and experiences of others. This great leap in cognitive ability is sometimes called **theory of mind**. 

With this new ability, **homo sapiens **could more easily pass down complex information from one generation to the next. Over time, our survival skills became more and more sophisticated. In the next blink, we’ll see how this dynamic kicked off the next stage of human society – the agricultural revolution. 

# Adopting agriculture sewed the seeds of hierarchy and inequality.

It’s 12,000 BCE and your hunter-gatherer tribe has a choice. You can continue as always, moving from place to place, feasting on whatever you happen to catch each day. Or, you can settle down, sew some grain, and await the harvest. 

The choice actually isn’t so easy. Sure, quitting your nomadic lifestyle for an agrarian existence provides some extra stability and lets you store more material goods. However, as a farmer, your diet will be less varied, your work will be more strenuous, and if you hate your neighbors, you’re still stuck sharing the same land.

What’s more, in taking up agriculture, you’re trading in an egalitarian society for one much more based on competition.

**The key message here is: Adopting agriculture sewed the seeds of hierarchy and inequality. **

Modern humans evolved as hunter-gatherers. Yet, many of the adaptations they picked up during this time perfectly prepared them for life as agriculturalists. Abilities like tool use, planning ahead, and dividing up labor were all necessary for establishing farming communities. However, establishing these communities also kicked off some radical changes to human society.

The most evident change was the gradual growth of material inequality. Nomadic hunter-gatherers had no effective way to store surplus food. Therefore, any big kill or foraging find was shared equally among the tribe. In contrast, agriculturalists could stockpile their surplus crops or unused tools from one season to the next. As a result, if you worked harder, had better luck, or had richer parents, you could become much more wealthy than your neighbor.

With the development of this so-called private property, different individuals or families accumulated more wealth, giving them more power or status in a sedentary society. To justify these differing material conditions, complex hierarchies took root, allowing people to occupy positions like chief, king, or feudal lord.

Of course, such inequality wreaked havoc on gender relations as well. While hunter-gatherer tribes enjoyed relative gender equality, the agricultural revolution kicked off a new era of competition. Men, driven by a biological imperative to take many mates, used the accumulation of wealth and power as a strategy to become more desirable to women. And women, in search of stability and resources to raise children, were motivated to pair with the most established men.

Still, as we’ll see in the next blink, even this artificially-enforced competition can’t fully quash our communal nature.

# The social skills that helped us survive are still with us today.

Imagine you’re dropped off in the middle of the forest completely naked and utterly alone. How long do you think you’d last before becoming dinner to some hungry tiger or bear. Probably not too long. 

Now, imagine a similar scenario. You’re still dropped naked into the woods, but this time you’re accompanied by 100 other humans in the same condition. How long do you last under these circumstances? 

Probably much longer. In fact, once you all get over the shock of the situation, you might just team up and make that bear **your** dinner. After all, one solitary human can’t accomplish much, but a whole lot of people can create a civilization. That is, if they can manage to work together.

**The key message here is: The social skills that helped us survive are still with us today.**

Because humans relied on each other to survive, we’re all innately driven to desire interpersonal connection. As babies, we instinctively interact with others through eye contact, imitating facial expressions, and incessantly babbling. As adults, we’re often obsessed with sharing our thoughts and feelings, and understanding our friends’ thoughts and feelings in return.

So, why this impulse to share intimate emotions? Well, it was very useful on the savannah. Consider: If you wanted to warn your tribe of a nearby tiger, what would be more effective – merely communicating the existence of the tiger, or also passing on the fear you felt of the tiger? Clearly, the latter. If your friends internalized your terror, they would be more likely to act carefully. 

This type of mental connection helps us coordinate plans as well. If you need your group’s aid on any large-scale project – from organizing a mammoth hunt to building an irrigation system – it helps to be able to convincingly convey how your plan will work and why it’s a good idea. Thus, humans developed a tendency to value traits like persuasive storytelling and confidence, both of which are fantastic survival tools.

An interesting side effect of all this emphasis on social sharing is our tendency to exaggerate and distort reality when it’s convenient. Think about it. If you want your fellow humans to be scared of an approaching predator, it makes sense to tell them it’s the biggest, most ferocious tiger there is. That will **really** get their attention!

# Technology is great, but our greatest inventions are social innovations.

Today, you probably woke up and checked your email on your smartphone. This simple act relies on countless technological inventions – from the chips in your phone, to the electricity in your home, to the satellites currently orbiting the Earth. 

Clearly, humans love innovating. It’s one of the qualities that sets us apart from other animals. But, consider this: The rolling suitcase wasn’t invented until 1970. 

So, how can a species that loves inventing take so long to dream up such an obviously useful device? Well, rather than relying on a technical invention, like attaching wheels to luggage, most people found a social solution to toting their heavy parcels around the airport. They paid porters to lug their bags.

**The key message here is: Technology is great, but our greatest inventions are social innovations.**

So, what’s the difference between technical and social innovation? Well, to start, a technical innovation usually means building or modifying a physical tool to accomplish a new purpose. The first person to make a spear by attaching a rock to a stick was a technical innovator.

In contrast, a social innovation leverages social relationships to solve a problem in a new way. For instance, dividing up labor to build tools more efficiently – that’s a social innovation. Assigning an arbitrary value to pieces of paper and using them as money – that’s also a social innovation. Even the concept of standing in line and waiting your turn is a social innovation.

These are just some of the big, hugely important social innovations that help our society operate. However, most people make small social innovations every day. In fact, finding solutions through our social connections seems to be the default way humans approach problem-solving. Astoundingly, studies show that only about 5 percent of people really engage in technical innovation at all.

Who are these outliers? According to the **social innovation hypothesis**, our technical wonders usually come from a small subset of people who are both technically inclined and socially disinclined. Think of a stereotypical engineer who loves tinkering but can’t keep up with small talk. 

This means that we really only reach for technical solutions once our social network has failed us.

# Social context determines if we cooperate or have conflicts.

April, 1994. After decades of political activism, Nelson Mandela is elected as South Africa’s first post-apartheid president. He uses his power to guide the country toward greater peace and equality, then retires after one term.

December, 1987. Robert Mugabe is elected president of Zimbabwe. He also makes much-needed reforms. However, in contrast to Mandela, he runs a corrupt regime that brutalizes his opponents, he enriches himself, and he clings to power for decades. 

Evidently, people are capable of great works of altruism and terrible acts of selfishness. Both these tendencies are the result of survival strategies developed over generations on the savannah. Today, both sides are in tension within society. Luckily, there is a pattern to which one wins out.

**The key message here is: Social context determines if we cooperate or have conflicts.**

In general, people are very good at cooperating within groups. This is especially evident when compared to our close cousin, the chimpanzee. When looking at rates of in-group violence, scientists found that traditional hunter-gatherer groups were 550 times less likely to engage in acts of aggression than chimps. This is because, when it comes to survival, there’s much more utility in working together as a group.

When violence does emerge within groups, it’s usually about competition for scarce resources. For instance, the Yanomamö, a hunter-horticulturalist people who live in the Amazon, will occasionally host brutal and deadly fights over territory, women, and leadership disputes. In contrast, the Hadza, a herder group from Tanzania, rarely resort to violence as most of their resources are shared in common and women are allowed to freely choose partners. 

However, the most surefire way to create in-group solidarity is to introduce a common threat. This makes sense given our evolutionary history. If your small band of humans is attacked by an outside force, setting aside your petty squabbles and working together is a matter of life or death. 

This dynamic is still present in our societies today, even within the large-scale complex world of international relations. In the United States, internal political partisanship has ebbed and risen along with the perceived presence or absence of external enemies. Consider the aftermath of the September 11 terrorist attacks. President Bush, who had middling support, was suddenly blessed with a 90 percent approval rating as Americans banded together against the concept of foreign foes. 

# Evolution has made happiness a tool of survival.

Fantastic news; you’ve just won the lottery! In an instant, you’ve gone from a life dedicated to stressful scrimping and saving to having more money than you can even imagine. Surely, as a newly-minted millionaire, you'll be ecstatically happy from this point on.

If only it were that easy. Incredible as it sounds, people who hit the jackpot don’t end up significantly happier. Sure, the first few weeks of lavish spending and luxury living give winners a temporary mood boost. But, studies show that after a year or two, almost all these lucky individuals return to their baseline levels of contentment. 

So, why this counterintuitive dynamic? Again, humanity’s history as a species just struggling to sustain itself provides some explanation. 

**Here’s the key message: Evolution has made happiness a tool of survival.**

To understand why a lottery win won’t bring a lifetime of happiness, we have to understand why happiness exists in the first place. Humans, like our ancestors before us, experience feelings of joy and contentment when we do something that is evolutionarily advantageous. Eating sweet snacks, having nice naps, and finding ideal mates are all actions that help us stay alive and pass on our genes.

However, the happiness these accomplishments bring us must be fleeting. Think about it. If one successful elephant hunt made you permanently happy forever, you would never be motivated to do anything else again. Sure, you’d be smiling and serene, but you wouldn’t live long or sire any offspring. Meanwhile, all your fellow humans would be out hunting and romancing, searching for that next rush of bliss.

Even today, the human brain must balance happiness and motivation. A study from the University of Virginia looked at how present happiness levels correspond to income growth over ten years. Unsurprisingly, the happiest people mostly maintained their current income. After all, things were already great, so why work harder? In contrast, moderately happy individuals saw the biggest income growth. Because they hadn’t attained peak pleasure, they were constantly pushing for more.

Of course, happiness plays other roles in our lives as well. Some studies show that happiness helps maintain a healthy immune system. In fact, more cheerful people tend to live longer than their glum counterparts. So, while diet and exercise are important, looking on the bright side may be just as crucial to sticking around in the long run.

# Build true happiness by following our evolutionary imperatives. 

What makes a happy animal? Well, due to evolution, most critters are happiest when they act in ways that prolong their lives and pass on their genes. In the wild, this means there’s a simple road to satisfaction. Just spend your days hunting prey, avoiding predators, and working on your mating call.

For humans, it’s not so straightforward. We just have too many options to choose from. After all, what’s better for our survival – practicing tennis or taking up tai chi? What will help us attract a mate – spending cash on clothes or dropping a few dollars on a new haircut? 

The truth is it can be hard to tell. Especially when modern society serves up so many options that make us happy in the short term but don’t deliver lasting fulfillment. 

**The key message here is: Build true happiness by following our evolutionary imperatives. **

So, evolution delivers us happiness when we survive and fulfill our reproductive potential. Does that mean everyone should just have as many kids as possible? Not necessarily. After all, there are plenty of unhappy parents around. Additionally, there are loads of people living delightful lives with no children, including seniors who have long since gotten too old to have kids of their own.

Really, what makes us happy is not the act of reproducing the human species itself, but being the type of person who can play a role in that process. That means cultivating a lifestyle and the personal qualities that make you a good potential mate and community member.

What does that look like? For one, it means staying physically healthy. Being happy is much easier if you feel good. Eat a balanced diet, get regular exercise and plenty of sleep. Also, maintain an active social life. Our ancestors only survived by sticking together, so we’re hardwired to find joy in things like strong friendships, teamwork, and cooperation. Don’t isolate yourself; make sure to spend lots of time with those you love.

Finally, find what makes you special. Sustaining your group and finding a mate was all about standing out by offering something of value. This could be a special talent, a wealth of knowledge, or a helping hand in times of crisis. Tap into this well of satisfaction by pushing yourself to always be learning or mastering a skill. 

These may sound like obvious answers, but our modern world often advises us to seek happiness in material goods or status symbols. These are nice, but it’s more important to have a rich, meaningful life that speaks to our social instincts.

# Final summary

The key message in these blinks:

**While humans are certainly a unique type of animal, deep down we’re still products of nature. Our habits, thought patterns, and behaviors are deeply informed and shaped by millions of years of evolutionary pressure. Our oldest ancestors only managed to survive by adapting complex social skills and adopting a collaborative, cooperative lifestyle. Those same basic instincts are still inside us today. As such, understanding the world and finding lasting happiness requires tapping into those social impulses.**
