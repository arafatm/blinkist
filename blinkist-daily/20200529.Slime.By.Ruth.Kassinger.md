 (2019) unlocks the mysteries of algae – that slimy stuff many of us don’t think twice about. Even though it may be a nuisance to owners of pools and aquariums, algae has a rich history in the development of both the planet and humankind. It holds some amazing potential for solving our problems with fossil fuels and the harmful emissions that are destroying our planet.


# What’s in it for me? Discover the fascinating history and world-changing powers of algae.  

If you’ve ever owned an aquarium, you’re probably all too familiar with algae. It’s the slimy stuff that coats the inside of the glass the moment you neglect your cleaning duties. Chances are, if you have any experience with algae, it isn’t something you fondly remember.

Yet, in one way or another, all of us have benefitted from the amazing role algae has played in transforming the world we live in, including our ancestors’ brains. That’s right – we owe a lot to algae! And given the shape our world is in now, it’s high time we became acquainted with these slimy organisms. As you’ll discover in these blinks, algae changed our planet once before and just might do it again.

In these blinks you’ll find out

- how algae may have changed the course of human evolution;
- why we should probably be eating more seaweed; and
- what a zoox is – and why it’s so important to coral reefs. 

# Algae played an important role in making the planet inhabitable for human beings.

What is algae? It may sound like a simple question, but the answer isn’t simple at all. Algae is a very broad term that covers a wide range of different organisms that can be found on both land and sea. It could refer to **microalgae**, which includes the single-celled organisms that can form pond scum, or **macroalgae**, which includes the seaweed that you might find in your favorite sushi roll.

There’s a good chance you’ve encountered algae in some form or another, but what you may not know is that algae have been around a lot longer than we have.

**The key message here is: Algae played an important role in making the planet inhabitable for human beings. **

If we turned the clock back 3.7 billion years, the planet was a very inhospitable place – at least for human beings and plant life. Back then, the planet didn’t have breathable oxygen, an ozone layer, or any soil. In fact, it would be another 3 billion years before the first plant arrived.

But there were oceans on Earth back then, and they were home to single-celled organisms like bacteria and **archaea**. Around this time, a new organism evolved and took up residence on the surface of the sea. Since it has a blue-green appearance, we call it **cyanobacteria** – otherwise known as **blue-green algae**. 

Cyanobacteria did something amazing: it performed the process of **photosynthesis**, which means it trapped solar energy and used that energy to make organic compounds. In this case, the process involved breaking down water into hydrogen and oxygen, and essentially burping that oxygen out.

Cyanobacteria could also multiply at an amazing rate – sometimes doubling every two hours. And so, over the next 2 billion years, the oxygen they made found its way into the atmosphere to form Earth’s protective ozone layer. This made it possible for things like plants and humans to exist and not be scorched to death by the sun’s rays.

But that’s not all! Cyanobacteria also created fixed nitrogen compounds like **ammonium**. These compounds are some of the essential building blocks of life and are what led to the formation of more complex ocean life.

# As the planet changed, microalgae was finally born.

Of course, creating complex life on Earth isn’t as simple as cyanobacteria coming along and burping out some oxygen. In fact, when the oxygen molecules first began to enter the atmosphere, they reacted with methane and turned it into carbon dioxide. The cyanobacteria then absorbed this during photosynthesis.

Methane and carbon dioxide are both greenhouse gases; by helping to remove these gases, cyanobacteria was helping to cool the planet. As a result, around 2.4 billion years ago, Earth entered into an ice age – during which cyanobacteria simply “chilled out,” so to speak, under the ice.

**The key message here is: As the planet changed, microalgae was finally born.**

Around 2.1 billion years ago, enough heat was released from volcanoes and deep ocean vents to melt the ice and thaw out the cyanobacteria. And when this happened, our algae met a new character: the **eukaryote**.

These are more complex organisms than the bacteria and archaea that were around before. Eukaryotes have sophisticated structures that include **flagella**, which are like little arms and legs that help them to swim around and grab food. Their advanced structures also allowed eukaryotes to fully absorb another organism, which is precisely what they did when they came across cyanobacteria.

But rather than killing the cyanobacteria, the two organisms formed a symbiotic relationship and gave birth to **microalgae**. From here, different varieties of red algae, blue algae, and brown algae would develop – though it would be another 1.8 billion years before they would truly flourish in the world’s oceans.

This waiting period is known as the **Boring Billion**, and what finally put an end to it was erosion. Earth’s land began to split apart and form separate continents, which caused a wealth of minerals to enter the oceans and feed the microalgae. Many species used the minerals to form protective armor – like the **coccolithophores**, which used calcium carbonate to create a round, white exterior. In fact, the skeletons of this microalgae are what make up the famous white cliffs of Dover.

Eventually, single-celled microalgae began to band together – perhaps as a way to become less vulnerable to predators – and multicellular algae began to emerge. The result of this evolution is **macroalgae** and, eventually, seaweed. And as we’ll find out in the next blinks, seaweed may have helped our own evolution in a significant way.

# While algae evolved, seaweed became rich in nutrients that would become important for humans.

All organisms evolve in ways that help them thrive in new environments. For some microalgae, this meant developing a slimy exterior that would protect them when they were stranded on land. Other algae formed a symbiotic relationship with fungi, thereby creating **lichen**, those colorful growths you find on oceanside trees and rocks.

**The key message here is: While algae evolved, seaweed became rich in nutrients that would become important for humans.**

In the water, macroalgae grew bigger. Some seaweed even developed root-like appendages called **holdfasts**, which didn’t provide any nutrients but helped the seaweed stay in place. These holdfasts don’t need to act like the roots of a plant. That’s because seaweed is already surrounded by all the nutrients it needs. 

Think about it – a plant’s roots are only going to grab nutrients that are in the ground and close by. Seaweed, on the other hand, is constantly exposed to nutrients as the water’s mineral-rich current keeps flowing by.

So, how nutrient-rich is seaweed? Consider **nori**, the dried seaweed that is a staple of many Japanese diets. Just 2.5 grams of nori contains significant amounts of vitamin A, vitamin B complex, calcium, magnesium, niacin, iron, and protein, just to name a few. 

But there are two nutrients in particular that have led scientists to believe that algae played an important role in the development of the modern human brain: **DHA** and **iodine**.

The first nutrient is DHA, also known as **docosahexaenoic acid**. It’s a type of polyunsaturated fatty acid, as well as an omega-3 oil, that’s found in the cellular membranes of the brain. That means DHA is necessary for any kind of brain growth.

The second nutrient is iodine. It’s a main ingredient in the hormones released by the thyroid, a gland at the base of the neck that gives us energy and helps us concentrate. Iodine also helps with memory and is required for healthy brain development in infants.

It turns out algae is rich in DHA, and one serving of kelp contains 2,000 micrograms of iodine. And since fish and shellfish feed on algae, they’re also rich in iodine and DHA.

So, how did algae come to affect human evolution? We’ll find out in the next blink.

# Due to its nutrient-rich nature, there is a growing demand for seaweed as a food.

There are still a lot of questions about human evolution. For example, what exactly happened that led us to develop such powerful, problem-solving brains?

At the Arizona State University’s Institute of Human Origin, Dr. Curtis Marean believes algae played a significant role in the development of homo sapiens. For 20 years, Dr. Marean has been excavating caves around Pinnacle Point, which is located along the southern tip of South Africa. The evidence he’s collected suggests that this is one of the places early humans thrived like they never had before. 

**The key message here is: Due to its nutrient-rich nature, there is a growing demand for seaweed as a food.**

Archeological evidence suggests that **Australopithecines**, a likely ancestor of homo sapiens, may have moved from inland Africa and Asia to the coastal areas. Once there, they were introduced to a whole new diet of algae and algae-fed seafood. This new food source may have provided them with the iodine and DHA that led to increased brain development and the evolution into early homo sapiens.

Given our current understanding of seaweed’s nutritional value, perhaps it’s unsurprising to find out that the market for this food is growing. Nori, in particular, is in huge demand, due to it being a common ingredient in sushi and a popular snack on its own. In 2013, over 1 million tons of nori were produced in China alone, while South Korea’s nori industry has been increasing by 8 percent every year.

Maybe more surprisingly, algae-based foods are getting more popular. Once upon a time, the Welsh diet featured a healthy amount of laverbread – a kind of ground seaweed that can be spread on toast. One serving provides 6 grams of protein, 33 percent of your daily vitamin A, high doses of B vitamins, and plenty of iron and iodine.

After going out of fashion in the twentieth century, laverbread is making a comeback in Wales, thanks in part to Jonathan Williams and his highly popular Pembrokeshire Beach Food Company. Williams reports that big companies – including Heinz and other readymade food manufacturers – have approached him with questions about laver and how it could be used to add more nutritional value to their products.

In fact, adding some seaweed to your diet is a very simple shortcut to increased vitamins and minerals. That’s why health-conscious people, and companies that want to promote healthier products, are doing just that. But as we’ll see in the next blink, the boom in growing and harvesting algae goes beyond just food. 

# There are potential game-changing developments in the use of algae for plastics and fuel.

From a farming perspective, seaweed has a lot going for it. For starters, you don’t need lots of arable land, fresh water, or expensive fertilizer. In fact, seaweed farming is a naturally sustainable business. And because land and fresh water are both quite scarce these days, algae is in a good position to be the crop of the future.

**The key message here is: There are potential game-changing developments in the use of algae for plastics and fuel.**

You can already find algae-based ingredients in many products. **Carrageenan, **an extract that comes from algae such as **Irish moss**, is used as an emulsifier in everything from cake mixes and salad dressings to lipsticks and toothpaste.

Because of their high protein content, algae are a prime candidate for use as a carbon-based polymer – the kind of thing that makes up plastics. The company Algix, formed in 2010, has been hard at work finding ways to turn algae into plastic, and they succeeded at making a version of EVA, or ethylene-vinyl acetate.

As it currently stands, the market for plastics is all about high volume and small margins. That means there are very few industries interested in making products that would be slightly more expensive, even if they were more sustainable and eco-friendly. However, the field of algae-based plastics is still in its infancy, so there may be good news yet to come.

Other fields that have considerable potential for far-reaching changes include algae-based oil and ethanol. But these efforts have run into similar profit-margin problems.

In 2012, after receiving over $100 million in funding from sources including ExxonMobil and Bill Gates, a company called Sapphire Energy began producing significant amounts of algae-based oil. By 2013, they’d made 1 million gallons of fuel oil. Around the same time, the company Solazyme was also producing renewable algae-based fuel oil and selling it at around $80 or $90 per barrel.

This price was quite competitive in 2011, when the standard price per barrel for crude oil was around $120. But everything changed in 2014 when hydraulic fracking, a new method of reaching more oil reserves, came along. Suddenly, oil prices shot down to under $2 per barrel, and the algae entrepreneurs couldn't compete.

The same can be said for ethanol, a fuel additive that’s used in gasoline for cars. Companies like Algenol have proved that it is possible to make algae-based ethanol. However, given how cheap corn-based ethanol is, Algenol is simply unable to compete with rock-bottom prices. But that doesn’t mean there isn’t a future for this renewable energy.

**“If jets and ships alone were running on algae by mid-century, I would call it a great triumph.”**

# Algae play a crucial role in maintaining healthy underwater reefs.

If you want to see evidence of climate change, look no further than the ocean’s coral reefs. What used to be massive, thriving, and brilliantly colorful concentrations of sea life have become white and desolate areas, largely devoid of life.

But coral reefs are more than just tourist attractions for divers. They also provide valuable protection, revenue, and food.

Coral reefs break ocean waves, and this helps protect shorelines from erosion. They also provide a biodiverse area that many people rely on for food. In fact, the UN Food and Agriculture Organization estimates that coral reefs generate around $30 billion in goods and services every year, while supplying 17 percent of the world’s protein.

**The key message here is: Algae play a crucial role in maintaining healthy underwater reefs.**

**Crustose coralline** algae are one of the main builders in coral reefs and help to populate the reef with other organisms. They do this by producing the chemical compounds that attract other crustaceans and larvae to settle down on the reef.

Essentially, a thriving coral reef is a huge symbiotic neighborhood, and when one piece of the puzzle goes missing, it can cause a chain reaction that leads to the desolation we see today. In this case, the key puzzle piece is **zoox**, the short name for **zooxanthellae**. This is a type of microalgae that can populate a single flower-like **coral polyp** by the millions.

Zoox capture sunlight and provide 90 percent of the nutrients they create to their hosts. Meanwhile, their hosts provide carbon dioxide and nitrogen so that the zoox can create more sugars. This sets off a food chain, starting with algae before moving to zooplankton, fish, coral polyps, and back again to algae. Nothing goes to waste. 

The problem is, over the past 40 years, sea temperatures on the surface have risen a full 1 degree Fahrenheit. As a result, photosynthesis among the zoox has radically changed, causing them to produce **superoxides** that can severely damage organisms and break down cell membranes. Sensing this change, hosts like the coral polyps have kicked the zoox out, setting off the devastating chain reaction that has resulted in lifeless reefs.

# 

**“To add to the corals’ misery, zoox are also endangered by the nitrogen from fertilizers and sewage that find their way into offshore waters.”**

# Algae blooms can be environmental hazards, but they also have the potential to help. 

Rising temperatures aren’t the only huge problem. Pollution is, too. In fact, another reason for the decline in coral reefs is the massive amount of fertilizer runoff and sewage that ends up in open waters. But this isn’t just a problem in oceans. It also affects lagoons, rivers, and seas all around the world.  

**The key message here is: Algae blooms can be environmental hazards, but they also have the potential to help. **

These days, when you hear about an algae bloom, it usually isn’t a good thing. There’s even an official acronym for harmful algal blooms: HABs.

Increasingly warm waters and the introduction of nitrogen from fertilizer runoff has resulted in a growing number of toxic algae blooms around the world. These conditions cause algae to produce **domoic acid,** which can turn the water red – hence the term “red tide” – or even green or bright pink. These toxic blooms lead to dead fish, a nasty smell, and make any mussels or clams in the area dangerous to eat.

It used to be that HABs were rare events, but now they show up like clockwork. For example, rising tides in Florida regularly cause sewers to overflow. And since 2006, this sort of runoff has caused red tides that can last over a year. It’s no wonder a HAB is also harmful to tourism, the fishing industry, and any commerce in the area.

Some people have been working on ways to fight algae with more algae, by introducing the Algal Turf Scrubber – or ATS for short – to areas that need to collect runoff. The first ATS was developed by Dr. Walter Adey as a natural aquarium cleaner; it consisted of a box of algae that collected excess nitrogen and phosphorus. But he soon realized that this could work on a larger scale. 

Take Florida’s Osprey Marsh, for instance. Here, the ATS is on track to prevent 20,000 pounds of nitrogen and phosphorus from entering the lagoon. However, when you consider that this ATS is cleaning 7 billion gallons of water annually – and that Osprey Marsh receives closer to 250 billion gallons of water from the St. Lucie River each year – it will take a lot more turf scrubbers to solve the problem.

And given the fact that the Baltic Sea is experiencing massive dead zones due to HABs the size of Montana – and that similar algae blooms are occurring regularly in the Gulf of Mexico and the Arabian Sea – something clearly needs to be done.

# There is a historical precedent for how algae could help reverse the damages of our current climate change.

Remember how microalgae helped kick off an ice age when they first appeared on the scene over 2 billion years ago? Well, given how temperatures have steadily been on the rise this past century, it’s not surprising that scientists are wondering if algae could cool things off once more.

**The key message here is: There is a historical precedent for how algae could help reverse the damages of our current climate change.**

That’s right, not all algae blooms need to be bad. The early bloom that removed greenhouse gases is known as the **Azolla Event**. And some researchers are wondering if a controlled version of this event could help relieve global warming. After all, it’s clear the polar ice caps are melting, and the Azolla Event is what brought back those caps billions of years ago.

The key ingredient to creating a similar event is **iron**. That’s because what triggered the Azolla Event was an enormous volcanic event that shot 40 thousand tons of iron into the atmosphere. When the iron landed in the oceans, the carbon-dioxide-absorbing algae sprang to life.

In 1988, British astrophysicist John Gribbon was the first to suggest recreating the Azolla Event by purposefully adding iron compounds into the ocean. He called it a “technological fix” to global warming, but there are still many questions and potential side effects that need to be dealt with.

For instance, what kind of algae should we target? What size and quantity of iron should we use? Can the blooms really be controlled in open waters? And could this lead to more toxic dead zones, killing more fish and wildlife?

Despite these ongoing concerns, initial experiments have been promising. Researchers have found that “1 pound of iron can fix 80 thousand pounds of carbon dioxide.” Their research also suggests that two types of algae are best at “sequestering carbon” and safely taking it to the bottom of the sea: silicon-rich **diatoms** and calcium-rich **coccolithophores**.

What’s also encouraging is that, in 2017, erosion off the coast of Greenland resulted in a natural iron-seeded, turquoise-colored algae bloom. Scientists from Stanford University monitored the bloom and found it led to no harmful side effects. But despite this encouraging news, the best estimates put iron-seeded algae blooms at being able to capture no more than 10 to 15 percent of the carbon dioxide currently being emitted worldwide. 

It’s true that it may not sound like much, but it’s certainly better than the path we’re on now. If we use controlled algae blooms and shift even a fraction of our industries to the eco-friendly and sustainable algae-based oils and plastics, we’d at least be taking a step in the right direction. 

# Final summary

The key message in these blinks:

**Algae is far more than slimy pond scum. Billions of years ago, microalgae helped remove greenhouse gasses and create the ozone layer that made life on Earth possible. The nutrients in algae such as seaweed are also likely to have led to brain growth in our early ancestors. Today, people are exploring the use of algae as an ingredient to add more nutrients to processed foods – and as an ingredient in fuels and plastics. Given the massive build-up in greenhouse gases over the past century, researchers are also looking to algae for its ability to remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. **
