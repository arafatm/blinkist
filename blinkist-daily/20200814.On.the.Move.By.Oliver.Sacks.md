 (2015) is a poignant memoir that tells the story of how Oliver Sacks became an acclaimed writer and neurologist. Published the year of his death, it provides a wistful account of his turbulent young adulthood – detailing his struggle with addiction and addressing his sexuality for the first time in print.


# What’s in it for me? Learn about the ups and downs of a life that fused science with storytelling.

When he was 12 years old, Oliver Sacks received a prophetic school report. One of his teachers summed up his prospects in a single sentence: “Sacks will go far, if he does not go too far.” 

As if to prove the point, young Oliver spent his free time at home conducting hazardous chemical experiments, which filled the house with noxious fumes. 

On the one hand, it was a precocious hobby, which reflected his budding interest in science and presaged his future career in medicine. On the other, he was lucky he didn’t burn the house down – and it wouldn’t be the last time his exploits would put his life in danger.

This is the story of how Oliver Sacks did indeed go far. He went on to become a best-selling, award-winning author and an esteemed neurologist, enlightening and entertaining millions of readers with his research and writing. But he by no means walked the straightest of paths to success. In his twenties and thirties, he took quite a few detours and almost went completely off track. For a while, he lived a double – or you could even say quadruple – life: doctor by day; avid motorcyclist, bodybuilder, and drug user by evening and on the weekends. 

At one point, he definitely **did** go too far – almost losing his life to addiction. Fortunately, he lived to tell the tale – a tale that you’ll get an intimate glimpse of in these blinks.

In these blinks, you’ll learn

- how his mother left a lasting wound on his psyche; 
- how he discovered his calling after years of turbulence and uncertainty; and
- why he almost got blacklisted from his profession right after finding it.

# A Taste for Literature

The year was 1950, and Oliver Sacks was 17. Traveling by himself, he’d just completed a cross-country skiing excursion in Norway, and he was about to board a ferry to return to England. At the duty-free shop by the harbor, he purchased some souvenirs to take home with him: a pair of two-liter bottles of aquavit – a strong Scandinavian spirit, ominously labeled “100 proof.” 

But then Oliver ran into a little problem. At border control, the Norwegian customs officers informed him that he was only allowed to bring one bottle of liquor into the UK. They were fine with him leaving the country with a second bottle, but their British counterparts would confiscate it upon his arrival to England.

What should he do? 

Well, sitting on the ferry’s upper deck in the frigid North Sea air, Oliver started drinking from one of the bottles to help keep himself warm. The other passengers had all taken shelter inside the cabin; Oliver was alone. But that was fine. He had his novel to read. And not just any novel, but **Ulysses** – James Joyce’s 700-page masterpiece.

He became so absorbed in the book that he didn’t notice the passage of time – or the depletion of the aquavit, which he was gradually draining sip by sip. Before he knew it, the ferry had arrived in England, and the bottle was empty. But Oliver felt completely sober. The alcohol must not be as strong as it claimed to be, he thought. 

He stood up – and immediately fell on his face. He was completely drunk. 

This wasn’t the first time he’d fallen for a book. A couple of years earlier, John Steinbeck’s **Cannery Row** had inspired him to want to become a marine biologist – the same profession as one of the novel’s main characters. Later, his interests shifted to neurology. But though he always had a scientific bent, Oliver also had a deep love of stories and storytelling. 

Part of it came from his mother. When he was a child, they spent hours at a time together reading classic books by British authors like D. H. Lawrence, Anthony Trollope, and Charles Dickens. When he was a bit older, he read the American novels of James Fenimore Cooper, along with narrative-driven books about science, such as Charles Darwin’s **Voyage of the Beagle**. And as a teenager, he became president of his secondary school’s literary society – a much more illustrious position than the one we left him in, lying flat on his face on the ferry’s upper deck. 

Fortunately, one of the boat’s crewmen found him there and helped him hobble off the boat with the aid of his ski poles, which he used as makeshift crutches. 

But although he couldn’t even stand up on his own two feet, Oliver felt triumphant – as if he’d won a victory over the system. As much as they might have enjoyed it for themselves, British customs wouldn’t be confiscating that second bottle of aquavit after all.

# Hurtful Words

The next year, right after Oliver turned 18, his father decided it was time they had a talk. Having received a scholarship to Oxford University, Oliver was about to leave his family’s home in northwest London to become a premedical student. Before he left, his father wanted to discuss something that had been weighing on his mind. 

The conversation started off innocuously enough, beginning with the topic of Oliver’s allowance and other money-related matters. But then it shifted into what his father really wanted to talk about: Oliver’s lack of girlfriends – and what it meant. 

“Don’t you like girls?” his father asked. 

“They’re all right,” Oliver replied, hoping that would be the end of the conversation. 

But his father pressed the matter: “Perhaps you like boys,” he suggested. 

Yes, Oliver admitted – but it was just a feeling, and he’d never acted on it. He begged his father not to tell his mother. 

This was 1950s England. Homosexual behavior was still a criminal offense, and it was widely considered both a moral perversion and a pathological condition. His mother had been born in the 1890s and raised in an Orthodox Jewish family, so Oliver suspected that she, too, had traditional, intolerant views on the subject. How would she respond if she learned her son was gay? He feared the worst, and he didn’t want her to find out. 

But his father told her anyway. Oliver never forgot what happened next. His mother came storming down the stairs, with a look of rage on her face that he’d never seen before. 

“You are an abomination,” she told him. “I wish you had never been born.”

As an adult looking back on the incident, Oliver would be able to put these awful words into perspective. In most areas of life, his mother was an open-minded person, and she was generally a kind and supportive parent. But, like all of us, she was a product of her circumstances, and in this one particular area her mind was closed off. 

On top of that, there was the fact that his younger brother Michael had schizophrenia. Given the way homosexuality was viewed at the time, she must have felt as if she were losing another son to a mental disorder. When she learned the truth about Oliver, she became overwhelmed and lashed out. For the next few days, she refused to speak to him – but then the silent treatment ended, their relationship resumed, and she never mentioned the matter again. 

She didn’t mean to hurt him. But, of course, her words hurt him deeply nonetheless, and the incident played a major role in Oliver developing an inhibited, guilt-ridden relationship to his sexuality, which plagued him for most of his life.

# A Talent for Writing

On paper, Oliver’s 20s and early 30s sound like those of the sort of high-achieving person who knows exactly what he wants to do with his life. A premed degree in physiology and biology from Oxford University. A medical degree, again from Oxford. Internships and research fellowships at various British and American hospitals and universities. It was an impressive CV. 

But truth be told, Oliver wasn’t sure what he wanted to do during this time. At a couple of points, he was torn between zoology and medicine – and even when he settled on the medical route, he still vacillated on whether he should pursue a clinical or a research career. He also doubted whether his choice of profession was really his own in the first place; both his parents were doctors, and he felt like they’d pressured him into following in their footsteps. Meanwhile, he still had a love for storytelling, and he had aspirations to become a writer. 

The long-term future was unclear to him – but, in the short term, there was at least one thing that was certain during his undergraduate years: he’d better do well in his anatomy classes. Otherwise, his mother – a surgeon and anatomist – would be deeply disappointed with him. 

A couple of years into his studies, the time came for him to take his final exams in the subject. Now, Oliver wasn’t very good at taking tests that centered on recalling lots of facts. Prior to entering Oxford, he’d failed his preliminary exams three times, before finally passing on the fourth try. So perhaps it should have come as no surprise that when the results of the anatomy exams were posted, Oliver ranked second-to-last in his entire class. 

Dreading his mother’s reaction, he went to his favorite pub and downed four or five pints of hard cider. And then a harebrained scheme came flashing into his mind: he’d make up for his dismal results by competing for one of Oxford University’s most prestigious prizes: the Theodore Williams Scholarship in Human Anatomy. This would require taking an essay exam. 

There were just two problems: the exam had already started – and Oliver was drunk. But that didn’t stop him from stumbling into the exam room, taking an empty seat, and scribbling away nonstop for the next two hours. 

There were seven questions. Oliver focused on just one of them and ignored the other six. “Does structural differentiation imply functional differentiation?” To answer this question, he worked out an argument and tried to back it up with every bit of zoological and botanical knowledge he could remember.  

That weekend, the results were announced in the **Times**. The winner of the prize was – Oliver Sacks! 

Maybe he wasn’t so good at factual recall, but he had a knack for writing essays. He’d develop this talent in the years to come, and it would provide him with a means of fusing his twin passions for science and storytelling.

# What Happened in Amsterdam

After graduating from Oxford, Oliver felt like he still had one last thing to do before he became a full-fledged adult. He was 22, and he still had to lose his virginity. 

The last year had been a rather dismal one. He’d stayed at Oxford to do a research project, and it hadn’t gone very well. To make a long story short, it involved an experiment with a bunch of chickens, and he ended up accidentally killing most of them. To make matters worse, his research supervisor was practically locked away in his office, totally unsupportive, and most of his friends at Oxford had left after graduating the previous year. Socially isolated and frustrated by his work, he was sinking deeper and deeper into depression. 

To revive his spirits, his parents convinced him to go to Israel and spend the summer of 1955 working in a kibbutz – a communal farm near Haifa. The physical labor, sense of community, and Israeli sunshine worked their magic, and he left Israel feeling fit, tan, and handsome. It seemed like the right time to finally have sex. 

So he headed to Amsterdam. He’d visited before, and it seemed like an open, friendly city – the sort of place where he could feel less inhibited. But when he got there, he didn’t know what to do. He still felt shy and anxious – emotions that plagued him throughout his life. In social gatherings, he tended to shrink into a corner and hope to be invisible. Now he was trying to break out of his shell and do something that had previously been unthinkable to him. 

To steel his nerves, he decided to liquor himself up at a bar. He drank so much that the barman cut him off. He stumbled out into the night and can’t remember what happened next. He must have blacked out. 

The next morning, he awoke in an unfamiliar bed. Apparently, a stranger had found him lying in a gutter and brought him back home, where they had sex. Oliver asked the man if it had been enjoyable, and he said yes. But he urged Oliver to never go about finding a sexual partner in such a way again. There was no need to get drunk, he said. Amsterdam was a tolerant, gay-friendly city, and he could just be himself. 

In his memoir, Sacks doesn’t comment on whether this sexual encounter was consensual, but he reports feeling so overwhelmed by the man’s message of acceptance that he cried tears of relief. Amsterdam became his favorite city in Europe, and he returned there many times throughout his life. 

But his relationship to his sexuality would continue to be constrained. As an adult, he only had a few fleeting sexual encounters and romantic relationships before the age of 40. And then, after one last fling with a stranger, he became celibate for the next 35 years.

# California Dreaming – An Interlude

If you’d known Oliver during his Oxford days and then ran into him on a weekday morning in 1961, you probably wouldn’t be too surprised by his appearance. Sure, he’s older now – 28. And the backdrop of his life has changed. Wanting to avoid the British military draft and escape the oversaturated UK job market, he’s relocated to San Francisco. But he’s doing the sort of thing you’d expect him to be doing: completing an internship at Mount Zion Hospital. 

If you saw him outside of work, however, you might do a double-take. In the evenings and on the weekend, he trades his white doctor’s coat for a black leather jacket. And his name is no longer Oliver Sacks. When he’s on the open road, riding atop his newly purchased Norton Atlas motorcycle, his biker buddies just call him Wolf – his badass middle name.  

Over the next couple of years, Wolf will upgrade to a BMW R69 and put more than 100,000 miles on the bike – roaming all over the American West and going on a cross-country road trip from California to New York and back. Along the way, he’ll befriend a pair of Southern truckers named Mac and Howard, and he’ll even become a medical consultant to the Hells Angels. 

When he isn’t on his motorcycle, he also spends a lot of his free time in San Francisco’s Central YMCA gym, lifting weights. He’s serious about it. He doesn’t just want to get into better shape; he wants to get into the record books. And in 1961, he does just that – setting a state squat record with a 600-pound bar on his shoulders. 

At the YMCA gym, he meets a nineteen-year-old Navy sailor named Mel – muscularly built, with perfectly smooth skin. Their relationship is ambiguous – platonic, but also intimate, with an undercurrent of simmering sexual tension. After working out together, Oliver takes Mel home on his motorcycle, with Mel sitting behind him, holding him tightly around the waist. On weekends, they go on camping trips, and they end up wrestling each other during their workout sessions. Oliver doesn’t dare take things further, but he starts to fantasize about spending the rest of his life with Mel. 

In 1962, Mel’s naval service ends, and Oliver gets a residency in the neurology department at UCLA, so they move down to Los Angeles together. There, Oliver becomes immersed in the bodybuilding scene at Venice’s Muscle Beach. Among other colorful characters, he befriends a weightlifting mathematician named Jim, whose hobbies include developing chess-playing programs on the Rand Corporation’s supercomputers – and then playing against them after taking LSD. 

As a budding neurologist who’s interested in the nature of consciousness, Oliver is intrigued by the psychoactive drugs floating around California at the time, and he starts experimenting with them himself – trying out LSD and morning glory, cannabis and amphetamine. 

It all sounds like a California dream – but it’s about to take a sharp turn into something more like a nightmare.

# Altered States

One evening, while living in their shared studio apartment near Muscle Beach, Oliver and Mel were having one of their routine massage sessions together. Mel was lying on the bed, facedown and naked. Oliver was sitting astride him, stripped down to his athletic shorts and rubbing oil onto Mel’s silky smooth back. They’d done this many times before, and it was so erotically charged that it would usually bring Oliver to the brink of orgasm. But there he always managed to stop himself, right in the nick of time.

On this fateful occasion, however, his excitement carried him past the point of no return. He orgasmed, and the semen landed on Mel’s back. Mel stiffened, got up silently, went to the shower, and refused to speak to Oliver for the rest of the day. The next morning, he announced he was moving out. 

Oliver felt like Mel had rejected him out of disgust, and it tore him up inside. He lost all hope of ever having a love life, and he moved into a small, isolated house in Topanga Canyon – a sparsely populated area nestled in the Santa Monica Mountains in Western Los Angeles County. He began sinking into depression – and to escape the pain, he began turning more and more to drugs. 

Up until now, he’d been experimenting with drugs as a recreational user. The altered states of consciousness that they produced seemed to provide a window into the underlying mechanics of the human mind, which he’d been fascinated with ever since he was a child. But now he was on the road to becoming an addict. 

A friend had introduced him to amphetamine. The drug’s effect on him was almost orgasmically euphoric, and he soon got hooked – needing bigger and bigger doses to chase the high. He stopped eating. He stopped sleeping.

During this time, he read about a science experiment in which some rats had electrodes embedded in the pleasure centers of their brains. They were given a lever they could push to stimulate themselves – and they’d become so obsessed with the resulting zaps of pleasure that they’d push it over and over again, until they died of exhaustion. 

Oliver felt like one of those rats. 

At this point, he’d gone from smoking amphetamine-laced marijuana to shooting methamphetamine straight into his veins. 

On top of the drug addiction, he also felt as if he’d become addicted to an “easy, sleazy” lifestyle in California, as he described it. He was still employed at UCLA, and he probably could have stayed there, continuing to do research on a neurological condition called axonal dystrophy. But he had bigger ambitions, and he wanted to re-devote himself to his work and find his true calling. A major change seemed in order. 

And so, in September, 1965, at the age of 32, Oliver Sacks moved to New York City, hoping to put California and his young adulthood behind him.

# Downward Spiral

Two months later, Oliver was sitting in a New York City cafe, stirring his cup of coffee, when all of a sudden the beverage began turning colors – first green, then purple. He looked up in alarm and saw a customer paying his bill at the counter. But something was wrong with the man. On top of his neck, there was a giant head shaped like an elephant seal’s. 

In a state of panic, Oliver ran out into the street and got onto a bus. Once inside, his terror only increased; all of the passengers had smooth white heads shaped like enormous eggs, and their eyes were huge and multifaceted, like the eyes of an insect. 

He got off the bus and called his friend Carol – a doctor he’d worked with back at Mount Zion. He told her he was calling to say goodbye. “I’ve gone mad, psychotic, insane,” he said.

Carol asked him what he’d done to himself. 

Well, by this point, he was taking large doses of amphetamine every day. The stimulant prevented him from sleeping, so he was counteracting it by also taking large doses of chloral hydrate – a sedative – every night. It turned out he’d run out of the drug the previous night, and now he was experiencing the withdrawal symptoms. The resulting delirium would last for four days. 

Clearly, Oliver was spiraling downward – his descent fueled by a couple of recent disappointments. One of them was his career, which seemed to be hitting a wall. He’d come to New York to do a research fellowship at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine. It seemed promising at first, but then it turned into a disaster. 

He’d always been clumsy and prone to losing things, and now that was coming back to haunt him. While driving on the Cross Bronx Expressway, his lab notebook with all of his research notes fell off the back of his motorcycle and landed on the road. He pulled over and tried to rescue it, but the traffic was too heavy and fast. He watched helplessly as the notebook was shredded to pieces by the passing vehicles. 

Meanwhile, at the lab, he was known for spilling hamburger crumbs all over the place. Some of them even got into one of the lab’s centrifuges, which he was using to study myelin – a neural substance he extracted from the nerve fibers of earthworms. 

And then, one day, he lost his myelin sample. He’s not sure how; maybe he accidentally threw it out. It had taken ten months – not to mention thousands of earthworm deaths – to collect the sample, so its loss was a major blow. 

His supervisors convened a meeting and told him he was a menace to the lab. Perhaps he was better suited for clinical work, rather than research, they not too subtly suggested. 

After living a life on the move for so many years, Oliver now seemed to be going nowhere but down.

# Epiphanies

By December, 1965, Oliver’s drug habit was causing him to miss work and lose weight at an alarming rate. In three months, he dropped nearly 80 pounds. When he saw his withered face in the mirror, he could hardly bear the sight. 

And then, on New Year’s Eve of that year, in the middle of yet another amphetamine-induced state of euphoria, he had an epiphany: if he didn’t get help, he wouldn’t see another New Year’s Day. 

Beneath his drug addiction were some pretty deep psychological problems, he suspected, so he started attending therapy sessions with a young psychoanalyst named Dr. Shengold. But the analyst told him that he would be beyond the reach of therapy until he stopped using drugs. 

Of course, kicking a drug addiction is easier said than done. Oliver sensed that he wouldn’t be able to do it unless he found satisfying, meaningful work to do. After all the disasters he’d experienced during his fellowship at Albert Einstein College of Medicine, research seemed like a dead end, so he decided to give up on it and try out clinical work instead. 

In October, 1966, he got a job as a neurologist at a headache clinic in the Bronx, working with patients who suffered migraines – the same condition that had plagued him as a child and first got him interested in the mechanics of the human mind. He began feeling better almost instantly. 

Not only did he care deeply about his patients; he also found their problems fascinating. For example, one of them was a mathematician who experienced his migraines in a weekly cycle. From Wednesday to Saturday, he’d start feeling more and more irritable and nervous. Then, on Sunday, he’d have a debilitating migraine. But by evening, the migraine would be gone; it was as if a storm cloud had lifted and the sun came bursting through. Over the next two days, he’d feel calm and rejuvenated, and he’d do highly creative work in mathematics. 

Oliver gave the man a medication, and it worked – but at a price. It cured his headaches, but it also took away his creativity. Apparently, the two were tied together. 

Another patient also suffered from a Sunday migraine, but, in his case, he seemed to be unconsciously using it to summon his family to his bedside and become the center of their attention for the day. When Oliver cured him, he found himself deeply missing their presence and concern. 

Each patients’ migraine was unique and tied to other aspects of his or her individuality.

One day, in February, 1967, Oliver had one more amphetamine-fueled epiphany: he should write a book about migraines, detailing some of the extraordinary things he was seeing at the clinic. In that moment, he had a vision of himself combining worthwhile clinical work with worthwhile writing.  

He had finally found his calling. From that day on, he never used amphetamine again.

# Another Headache

In the summer of 1967, at the age of 34, Oliver went back to England for a vacation. While he was there, he experienced a sudden burst of creativity, and he wrote out a first draft of his book about migraines in just a couple of weeks. The words practically poured out of him. 

If life were simpler, he would have just delivered the manuscript to the publisher, and the rest would have been history. But, alas, life is not so simple. 

Back at the headache clinic in the Bronx, Oliver’s supervisor, Dr. Arnold P. Friedman, read what Oliver had written – and he hated it. Dr. Friedman was an old, established authority in the world of migraine studies.To him, Oliver seemed like a presumptuous youngster who didn’t know his place in the medical world’s pecking order. The esteemed doctor had been working at the migraine clinic for more than two decades; Oliver had only been there for a year. Who was he to write a book about the subject? 

Oliver had based his book on observation notes he wrote about his patients while working at the clinic. Knowing this, Dr. Friedman tried to undermine the book by confiscating Oliver’s notes and refusing to grant access to them. 

Not only that, but he went so far as to threaten to fire Oliver and make sure he never got a job in neurology in the US again if he went ahead with seeking publication of his book. At the time, Dr. Friedman was the chair of the headache section of the American Neurological Association, so this was no idle threat. 

Oliver’s parents advised him to back down and avoid angering Dr. Friedman, warning that he could ruin Oliver’s career. For a few months, Oliver tried to follow their advice, but then he couldn’t stand it anymore. He convinced a janitor to let him into the clinic in the middle of the night; between midnight and 3:00 a.m., he snuck in and copied his notes by hand. Once he had what he needed, Oliver informed Dr. Friedman that he was going to England for a long vacation. The doctor asked if he was going there to finish his book. 

“Yes,” Oliver said. “I have to.” 

“It’ll be the last thing you do,” the doctor replied.

But Oliver went back to England anyway. A week later, he received a transatlantic telegram informing him that he was fired.

# The Story Goes On

Although he’d just been fired, Oliver felt a strange sense of relief. Sure, he was now unemployed and about to maybe get blacklisted from his profession, but he was also free to finish his book. 

By this point, he’d already finished a draft of the manuscript and secured a publishing deal with Faber &amp; Faber, a British publisher. And, once again, if life were simple, that would have been the end of the story. He would have just polished the manuscript, sent it off for publication, and gone on to become a famous writer who wrote many critically acclaimed books. 

All of those things would happen – eventually. But first, Oliver had to face one final obstacle: himself. The truth was, Dr. Friedman wasn’t the only person who didn’t like his migraine book; Oliver didn’t like it either – and so he decided to rewrite the whole thing. 

He cranked it out in another burst of creativity, and the book – titled **Migraines**, appropriately enough – was finally released in January, 1971. It went on to receive positive reviews in British publications such as the** Times**, the** Lancet**, and the** British Medical Journal.** 

From this point on, Oliver would be both an acclaimed writer and a neurologist – but you could also call him a compulsive rewriter and meddler in his own work. In 1972, he’d submit his second book for publication, following many revisions. It was called **Awakenings**, and it would be an even greater success than his debut – but right after he submitted it, he realized that he **had** to add some footnotes, or else the book would be ruined. He ended up writing 400 footnotes that added up to a text three times longer than the actual book itself. 

Fortunately, Oliver had an editor who could keep him in check. His name was Colin Haycraft, and he insisted that Oliver pare his 400 footnotes down to a modest 12. When the galley proof pages for the book were ready, Colin refused to let Oliver see them, fearing he’d try to make more changes and additions. 

Over the next 13 years, the two men continued to work together on Oliver’s subsequent books: **The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat** and **No Leg to Stand On**. The latter was based on Oliver’s experience recovering from a leg injury that he suffered during a confrontation with a bull in the mountains of Norway (but that’s another story). 

When he finished the first manuscript of **No Leg to Stand On**, it was a staggering 300,000 words long. Colin, ever ready to keep Oliver in check, insisted on reducing it to one-fifth its original length. 

In the winter of 1983, right after Oliver relinquished the final manuscript for publication, he slipped and fell on some ice at a gas station and broke his leg. 

When he learned that Oliver had injured his leg once again, Collin exclaimed, “Oliver! You’d do anything for a footnote.”

# Epilogue

Epilogue:

**Oliver Sacks went on to become a highly acclaimed author. Over the course of his career, he wrote more than a dozen books. He also continued to work as a neurologist in various hospitals and clinics in New York, where he lived for the rest of his life. **

**He specialized in treating, studying, and writing about patients with unusual neurological conditions, such as encephalitis lethargica – better known as “sleepy sickness.” Patients with this rare brain disease end up motionless and speechless, and yet they are still partially conscious, as if they were trapped in a state between sleep and wakefulness. With the experimental use of a drug called L-DOPA, Oliver managed to bring many of these patients fully awake at Beth Abraham Hospital in the Bronx. The experience became the basis of his award-winning book **Awakenings**, which was later turned into a movie starring Robert De Niro and Robin Williams.**

**Most of Oliver’s other books also centered around case studies of his patients, whose conditions he wrote about in a literary style that was highly unusual for the medical writing of the time. His books were narrative-driven and people-focused, describing his patients’ experiences, personalities, and stories in rich detail. They read more like novels than like dry, academic texts. **

**In adopting this style, Oliver Sacks was inspired by nineteenth-century medical case studies. To the medical establishment of his time, these studies seemed hopelessly old-fashioned. But Oliver believed they possessed an invaluable human element that was not only missing from contemporary medical texts but from education and clinical practice in general. With his award-winning, best-selling books, Oliver helped to bring this type of medical writing back into prominence.**
