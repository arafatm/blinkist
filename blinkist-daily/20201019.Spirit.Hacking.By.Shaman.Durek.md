 (2019) provides a beginner’s guide to shamanism. These blinks outline the core beliefs of this spiritual practice and describe simple techniques for integrating shamanism into your life.


# What’s in it for me? Light up your life with shamanism.

Do you ever get that feeling that something’s not quite right as you’re going about your daily routine?

Many of us do. Whether it’s dissatisfaction with our jobs, a general feeling of stress, or a chronic pain that won’t go away, the result is the same. We feel trapped and unhappy.

With a growing sense of unease, we often try to find comfort in material goods and retail therapy. But these blinks will show you a better path to fulfillment.

You’ll uncover the secrets of shamanism and learn what this ancient spiritual practice can do for your well-being. Along the way, you’ll find out what’s really holding you back in life and gain the keys to unlocking your full potential. Armed with these fascinating insights and practical tips, you’ll discover the way out of the darkness and into the light of love and contentment.

In these blinks, you’ll discover

- how the matrix has you trapped;
- why the future is happening now; and
- what you need to say to the underworld spirits.

# The matrix funnels you along the pipeline of a mediocre existence.

You might assume you know what a good life looks like. Perhaps you think it involves a prestigious education, a well-paying job, and a mortgage on a family home. But is this conventional lifestyle always the path to happiness? Dig a little deeper, and you may see that you’ve been brainwashed into believing it is.

This may sound disturbing, but Shaman Durek believes it’s the truth. For your entire life, you’ve been tricked into wanting these things by a system Durek calls the **matrix**. The matrix is a set of rules and regulations that invisibly governs our lives. Despite its influence over us, few of us ever question it.

**The key message here is: The matrix funnels you along the pipeline of a mediocre existence. **

The matrix keeps us on a straight and narrow path from school, to college, to the office, to the grave. But the matrix doesn’t just keep us moving predictably forward. It keeps us in boxes, too – boxes with labels like race, gender, and religious beliefs.

The matrix tells us we should all stay in our own boxes with people who are just like us. That means never climbing out and exploring the rich variety inherent in humanity and all the different choices that the world has to offer.

Disturbingly, the matrix keeps us on this dull treadmill of existence by drugging us. It drugs us with junk food that makes us sick and pills that make us forget our pain. Deep down, most of us are unsatisfied in the matrix’s daily rat race. We yearn for a satisfaction that we just can’t get from bad food, alcohol, or caffeine.

So why haven’t we destroyed the matrix and started living better, freer lives? Because, unfortunately, the matrix** **is powerful. It’s an instrument of the **darkness**.

According to Shaman Durek, the darkness contains everything in the universe that isn’t aligned with love. The darkness surrounds human beings and creates conflict and isolation. It makes us see everything in black and white. We start thinking of things as either good or bad, with nothing in between. We even think of **people** as being good or bad – and when that happens, war and suffering usually follow. Instead of coming together to dismantle the matrix, we fight each other. 

But we can escape the matrix. In the following blinks, we’ll explore shamanism and find out how we can free ourselves.

# Shamans are able to communicate with spirits.

It’s often said that seeing is believing. For something to exist, it must have a physical presence. But what if everything you’ve been taught about the laws of reality is wrong? Incredibly, shamans regularly perceive things that don’t exist in the three dimensions we can see.

Shamanism is an ancient practice that teaches us that we are surrounded by more than meets the eye. Shamans believe that there are infinite dimensions in the universe, extending far beyond the three dimensions we typically talk about. According to shamanism, there are also infinite vibrational energies surrounding us. With the right training and tools, we can learn to perceive these extra dimensions and energies.

Shamans believe that everything on Earth – from humans to trees and stones – contains a life force, an energy, and a spirit of its own.

**The key message here is: Shamans are able to communicate with spirits.**

It may sound incredible, but shamans learn from these spirits and believe that every life force has its own intelligence. Consider a tall tree, for instance. Sure, you won’t be able to discuss great works of literature with it, but it still has wisdom to share. After all, it has grown strong and tall over time, and it has deep roots.

For as long as there have been humans, there have been shamans. Traditionally, they worked with spirits for the good of their tribe. Even today, when someone or something gets out of balance and is in need of healing, shamans communicate with the spirits in order to restore harmony and vitality.

Different shamans communicate with different sorts of spirits using different methods. Water shamans in Indonesia, for example, only communicate with water spirits. There are also animal and plant shamans, many of whom perceive spirits through taking hallucinogenic substances extracted from plants and animals.

The author is a **spirit shaman**. That means he doesn’t need water or any other substance to connect him with the spirit realm, because he is surrounded by spirits all the time. Spirit shamans act as vessels through which spirits can flow. In his sessions, the author might channel the spirit of a Tibetan monk or an African tribesman. As these spirits inhabit his body, he sometimes speaks in tongues, or in languages of which he has no knowledge.

As you’ll discover in the next blink, shamanism can help us to break free from the matrix that controls our lives.

# Step outside the matrix and discover your authentic self.

All too often, we let the matrix decide our desires for us. We let it tell us that we want flashy cars, big houses, and high social status. The matrix convinces us of these shallow desires through a seductive propaganda system known as the **high glamor**.

High glamor keeps us in a constant state of yearning for material goods. It’s everything from the fashion industry that makes us feel ugly to social media and the entertainment industry that keeps us obsessed with celebrities. So how can you free yourself from the matrix’s endless cycle of desire and materialism?

**The key message here is: Step outside the matrix and discover your authentic self.**

Once you understand who you are and what you want, you can focus on taking action and avoiding the confines of the matrix.

Sadly, this is harder than it sounds, because everyone’s wills have been made weak by the high glamor. We are easily distracted from our own goals and entranced by the glitz of consumerism.

But here’s one way you can strengthen your will: the shamanic technique known as** fire screeing.** African shamans believe that fire enhances our perception, so fire screeing helps you cultivate a sense of understanding and devotion toward your authentic self and your true desires.

To practice this technique, all you need are five candles, a timer, and a dark room. Sit in the center of the room and put four of the candles in a circle around you – one for each direction on the compass. Place the fifth candle in front of you, then light all five candles and set your timer for five minutes. Now, look directly into the burning flame in front of you. Hold a particular thought in your mind while you watch the flame dance. This thought can be about anything. You could think about the love of your life or your dream job. 

Keep looking at the flame and holding onto this thought for the whole five minutes. The thought is a symbol of your devotion to your true self, and your gaze is a symbol of your commitment.

Fire screeing nurtures the fire inside of you and helps you to see more clearly. It’s a powerful way to break out of the matrix and discover truths about yourself.

**“I increase the fire inside of my being to allow me to see in all directions.”**

# Time isn’t linear, so success is never far away.

Understanding your authentic self is crucial if you’re going to leave the matrix, but it’s not the only tool you’ll need. You’ll also have to equip yourself with some brand new beliefs. Specifically, you’ll have to change how you think about hard work and success.

But before we explore these new beliefs, let’s check in with a belief that you likely already have.

If you’re anything like most people, you probably think that achieving your dreams will take a lot of time and hard work. You assume that, if your dreams ever come true, it’ll happen in the distant future, once you’ve “paid your dues” and suffered in pursuit of them.** **

But this is a belief you need to let go.

**The key message here is: Time isn’t linear, so success is never far away.**

The incredible truth is that all human beings are born with infinite amounts of creative power and potential. This means that creating an authentic, successful life doesn’t need to be difficult or take a long time. You can live that successful life in the present. You don’t have to wait until the future arrives.

In fact, the future is already happening. This might sound strange, but shamans don’t believe that time is linear. Instead, they believe that the present, the future, and the past, all coexist, and the future is constantly shifting, according to the choices you make in each present moment.

You can use this nonlinear sense of time to achieve your dreams sooner rather than later.

One simple technique for success involves changing the tense you use to think about your goals. Instead of telling yourself what you’re **going** to do, or what you hope is **going** to happen, talk about it as if it’s **already** taking place. For example, rather than saying to yourself, “My book is going to be published and read by thousands,” you could say, “My book **is** published and is being read by thousands of people right now.”

When we talk about our goals as if they’ve already been achieved, our minds start thinking of them as a concrete reality rather than as a hypothetical future. When that happens, your ego, which always wants you to be correct, is motivated to make sure that the future conforms with your mind’s expectations. And before you know it, you’ve turned your wishful thinking into a dream come true.

# You can banish the darkness by confronting your underworld spirits.

We’ve learned that the author defines the darkness as everything in the universe that is not aligned with love and positivity. But how does this darkness show up in our lives? What does it look like?

When you think of the darkness, you might imagine ghouls and goblins and devils with pitchforks. But actually, the darkness is not as overtly terrifying as that.

Oftentimes, the darkness shows up as a little voice in your head. As your own voice, in fact. This voice tells you that you’re not worthy of love or that you’ll never be good enough. But although it **sounds** like your own voice whispering in your ear, it doesn’t belong to you. Unlikely as it may seem, Shaman Durek believes this voice actually belongs to a spirit in the underworld.

**The key message in this blink is: You can banish the darkness by confronting your underworld spirits.**

You may be wondering how this works. The author explains the underworld as a place where human souls get trapped. If a person dies before they can come to terms with a traumatic experience they’ve had, their spirit gets stuck in limbo in the underworld. Then, when a living person suffers the same trauma as a particular underworld spirit, that traumatized spirit is attracted to them and starts to feed off their feelings of discord and sadness.

So how do we deal with these underworld spirits? Well, not with sharp stakes and garlic, that’s for sure. If you want to free yourself, you’ll need to treat these spirits with compassion and help them leave the underworld once and for all.

You can do this with a simple exercise. Start by standing up and folding your arms. It’s important to take a powerful stance, so the darkness knows it can’t mess with you anymore.

Now, begin listening to the voice in your head that’s been getting you down. Interrogate this voice, but don’t get angry or be judgmental. Ask it whether it’s a spirit from the underworld. The spirit will be honest with you and tell you if it is.

Once you know you’re dealing with an underworld spirit, ask it why it has been following you around for so long. Finally, when you’ve come to terms with the spirit and why it’s in your life, it’s time to release this anguished underworld soul.

Simply tell it you’re taking it back into the light – into a place where it has the love it craves.

**“Spirit, I am taking you into the light, to a place of unconditional love and comfort.”**

# You may be able to heal chronic pain by connecting with your ancestors.

Many of us live with chronic pain – pain that won’t go away, but that doctors seem powerless to explain or treat. Some people live with this agony their whole lives, never understanding the phenomenon that caused it or what they need to do to heal.

Shamans believe that the root of some chronic pain lies deep within the molecules of our body’s cells. This pain has been passed onto us from our ancestors, who suffered before us.

Modern Western culture would have you believe that your ancestors no longer exist – that once someone dies, they are gone forever. But as we learned earlier, shamans understand that there are many different dimensions, and time is not linear. This means that your ancestors are still here now, walking alongside you with every step you take.

**The key message here is: ****You may be able to heal chronic pain by connecting with your ancestors****.**

As Shaman Durek sees it, many of the more ancient human lineages and tribes have unresolved ancestral pain built into their genetic material, which causes the current generation to suffer. So if you want to heal your own pain, you’ll need to heal your ancestors’ pain, too.

To start the healing process, you’ll need to forge a stronger connection to your ancestors. For some cultures, this is a natural part of life. For instance, Mexico’s **Día de los Muertos**, or Day of the Dead, is a holiday during which people put out gifts, food, and drinks to honor their forebears.

You can create your own ancestor ceremony by making an ancestor altar. Lay out a table with a photograph or a drawing of an ancestor you’d like to connect with. Now, put gifts on the table that you think they’d like. You could also put down gifts that represent something **you** would like to receive yourself. For example, if you want to receive prosperity, then you could offer a few coins to your ancestors. Finally, light a candle to your ancestor and put this on the altar as well.

Sadly, other negative things can be passed down to us from previous generations, too – not only physical pain. The dysfunctional beliefs of our ancestors echo down our bloodlines: perhaps your great-great-grandfather had negative beliefs about money and believed his family would always be poor. These beliefs can still affect your life and your attitude to money today.

Luckily, you can rid your bloodline of damaging beliefs like these by confronting them and transforming your own attitudes. This won’t just benefit you, but every generation of your family – past, present, and future.

# Every species on Earth is sentient and powerful.

In the modern digital age, the internet is usually our first port of call for information. We assume that any knowledge that’s worth having can be found online. But there’s another world wide web at our fingertips – if only we would open our minds to see it. It’s a network of knowledge that exists in the natural rather than the digital world, and its name is **Gaia**.

Gaia is what shamans call Mother Nature. Gaia is a feminine spirit, and she brings harmony to the world with her gifts of sun and soil and oceans.

Shamans respect Gaia as a conscious and intelligent life force. But sadly, most of humanity refuses to respect the natural world or the other species that share our planet. We go around thinking of ourselves as the only earthlings that matter.

**The key message here is: Every species on Earth is sentient and powerful.**

As if human arrogance wasn’t bad enough on its own, our disrespect for Gaia also has devastating consequences for our planet. Yet most of us say nothing about the mining, logging, and climate change that threatens all of our lives.

With this in mind, it’s about time for all of us to get closer to nature so that we can start to appreciate it and stop its destruction.

You can forge a greater connection with nature by tapping into its powerful healing properties. Shamanism teaches us that we can communicate with flowers, grass – and even the soil – and harness their energy vibrations. 

For this technique, it helps if you’re physically close to the thing whose spirit you want to feel. For example, if you want to log into the world wide web of nature and communicate with a flower, then simply hold your finger up in front of the flower. Now draw a square in the air with your finger. In shamanism, this symbolizes the space in which you will hold the flower’s spirit.

Next, draw a triangle within the square to represent your shamanic antennae, through which the spirit will be channeled. Ask the spirit of the flower to flow into you. Say out loud that you want to feel the spirit’s presence in your body. Once you feel connected with the flower spirit, you can direct its energy to the part of you that needs healing.

As shamanism shows us, we don’t always need the internet to make a connection.

# Final summary

The key message in these blinks:

**Too many of us are spending our lives trapped in the matrix – the system that has brainwashed us into leading conventional, materialistic lives that alienate us from our authentic selves. You can defeat the matrix and the darkness it serves, by stepping out of the box that society has put you in, embracing your true self, and letting yourself be guided by the spirits and the energies that surround you. ******

Actionable advice:

**Take action against the darkness.**

It might be true that the system is designed to trap us in the matrix, but that’s no excuse for not taking action. Now that you know about the darkness we’re all dealing with, it’s up to you to fight it. So take a good, hard look at how you’re currently living your life and ask yourself whether you could make a more positive contribution – either to humanity or to Gaia.
