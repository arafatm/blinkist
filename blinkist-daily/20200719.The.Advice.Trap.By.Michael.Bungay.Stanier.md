(2020) is a practical guide to taming your inner Advice Monster. Many of us give advice compulsively because we’re insecure and want to control the situations we’re in. But that comes at the cost of alienating ourselves from other people, and stifling innovation in the workplace. Instead of jumping in with solutions, we need to cultivate a deep sense of curiosity and really learn to listen to other people.


# What’s in it for me? Become a better leader by reaching for challenges, not solutions.

Do you ever feel frustrated that people don’t follow your good advice? Or end up drained by trying to help too many people?

Those feelings come from being in thrall to your Advice Monster – that inner voice that constantly wants to tell other people what to do.

In these blinks, you’ll learn exactly where that voice comes from, and why needing to come up with solutions all the time can be so destructive to your relationships and ability to lead.

You’ll discover how to master the art of listening and why asking questions is ultimately more important than giving advice. And you’ll see how all these things can help you develop empathy and humility, as you come to realize that you aren’t the only one with good ideas.

In these blinks, you’ll learn

- why trying to save people pushes them further away;
- how our brains are wired to protect us from stressful situations; and
- why people try to sabotage their own coaching sessions.

# Giving unwanted advice gets in the way of finding real solutions.

We’ve all had the experience of wanting to give advice when somebody is talking about a problem. Before we know it, solutions pop into our heads that we’re just dying to share.

So, why shouldn’t we? Isn’t it helpful to come to someone’s aid when they’re struggling?

Well, there are some situations where it’s definitely helpful to give advice. For example, if someone asks where the restroom is, it would be a bit weird not to tell them how to find it.** **But, most of the time, our knee-jerk desire to tell people what to do is actually counter-productive.

**The key message here is: Giving unwanted advice gets in the way of finding real solutions.**

Let’s look at what’s going on. Often, when people tell us about their problems, we’re so desperate to tell them what to do that we don't really listen to what they're saying.** **It can take a while for someone to get to the point. If we jump in with advice too soon, we run the risk of advising them on the wrong thing because we haven’t taken the time to listen to what they’re really concerned about.

Even if we do get it right, most of the time we’ll end up giving mediocre advice anyway. That’s because the majority of us don’t listen deeply enough to pick up the necessary information. Instead, we rely on limited knowledge and our own assumptions to find a solution. In our rush for a quick fix, we hold on to the first idea we have instead of throwing out a few and looking for the best one.

Compulsively giving advice also affects our well-being. It’s exhausting trying to solve the world’s problems and do everybody else’s jobs for them all the time. And if you’re a business leader, spending all your time stuck in other people’s problems means you’ve no time to look at the big picture.

It’s also no fun being on the receiving end of a barrage of unsolicited advice. It can feel undermining, like people don’t trust you to make your own decisions or come up with solutions by yourself.

Those of us who constantly give advice are our own worst enemies. By underestimating the capabilities of the people around us, we strangle innovation and exhaust ourselves. In order to break the cycle, we must come face-to-face with our inner Advice Monsters.

# We all live with an internal Advice Monster – and it’s time to get it under control!

That voice whispering in your ear – the one that says you have all the solutions – is your personal Advice Monster. Your Advice Monster is an important part of your personality that developed in times when you were stressed, and wanted to feel more in control of a situation. The monster commonly comes in three personas.

The first is called “Tell-It.” This monster convinces you that the only way to add value to a situation is by being the leading authority, and always having the right answers. It loves hogging the spotlight and explaining, loudly, why its opinion is more important than anybody else’s.

**The key message here is: We all live with an internal Advice Monster – and it’s time to get it under control!**

The second type of Advice Monster is called “Save-It.” This persona is more subdued, which makes it harder to spot. “Save-It" types won’t jump on a soapbox to shout about their ideas, but they’re equally convinced that they hold all the solutions. What’s more, they believe that they – and only they – can save the situation, and it’s their moral responsibility to do so.

Lastly, there’s the most manipulative Advice Monster of all – the “Control-It” persona.** **This monster wants to convince you to keep a tight grip on all things at all times, or risk plunging your world into chaos. It teaches you that others are not to be trusted, so you must bravely run the ship by yourself – or else!

It doesn’t take a lot of imagination to work out how these Advice Monsters might limit our lives. They prevent us from letting other people in, and from being open to different ways of seeing the world. And they pile impossible amounts of responsibility on our shoulders by deluding us into thinking we’re superheroes – destined to save the world one piece of advice at a time.

So how can we get rid of these monsters?** **The bad news is that we can’t – they’re part of our personalities. They actually developed to help us deal with difficult emotions. Getting rid of them would be denying important parts of ourselves.

The good news is that while we can’t get rid of them, we can tame them – and make them work with us instead of against us. But first, we need to get to know them better.

# Stressful situations can trigger our Advice Monsters.

Just as puppies tend to start excitedly yapping whenever a car passes, there are certain things that will set off our Advice Monsters and make them even noisier. To start taming your monster, you need to identify your personal triggers. Which people – and which situations – are most likely to set off your advice-giving reflexes?

For the author, it’s time spent with his brother. No matter how mindful he tries to be, something about being with his sibling makes his Control-It persona itch to come out and start managing the situation.

**The key message here is: Stressful situations can trigger our Advice Monsters.**

For others, being around strangers may spark their Advice Monster.** **Or being with people who seem less experienced than them. Once you’ve identified the people that bring out this impulse, start identifying the situations. Do you feel compelled to give out advice at work? What about in political debates?** **Or when you feel out of your depth?** **These triggers are unique, and will differ from person to person.

Next, start thinking about how you behave in trigger situations. What does your Advice Monster do when it swings into action? Do you give your teammates solutions they haven’t asked for? Or try and take control by filling silences when out on a date? This exercise might make you cringe, but it’s important to be honest. Having specific examples will help to break the advice-giving cycle.

Once you’ve got some good examples, you can start looking at the payoffs – and costs – of your compulsive, advice-giving behavior. We keep giving advice because we get a small reward for doing it. For example, you may feel helpful or smart when you come up with a solution. Or you may feel in control when you dominate a meeting. But there will be a cost, too.

Constantly giving advice can negatively affect your relationships and potential to lead, leaving you isolated and overwhelmed. In order to really change and grow, you must let go of immediate gratification and work on building a “future you” that doesn’t give advice as a reflex, or out of fear. Think what will be possible when you stop trying to control situations, and can instead just be with people without any agenda!

# Instead of proposing solutions, we need to ask more – and better – questions.

Toddlers are famous for asking questions as they look at the world around them. Why are ladybugs red?** **Why are we eating peanut butter sandwiches for lunch?** **Why does that classmate have two mothers?

They’re frank and open and very, very curious. But as we grow up, we lose that vital art of asking questions, and instead start wanting to tell everybody else what we think. If we want to become good leaders, it’s time to get back to basics.

**The key message here is: Instead of proposing solutions, we need to ask more – and better – questions.**

So how do we learn to ask good questions? The most important thing is to keep them short and simple, and make sure that they are genuinely open-ended. For example, beginning a conversation by asking “What’s on your mind?” allows the other person to answer in any way they choose. Whereas questions starting with phrases like “Wouldn’t you agree...” or “Don’t you think...” are actually just statements pretending to be questions. They close the conversation down.

Once we get a reply to our first question, we need to quash the urge to jump in with advice, and instead ask follow-ups like "What else?” This simple question is so powerful because it forces people to dig deeper, and reveal any underlying challenges they might have missed.

Another great follow-up is to ask, “What’s the real challenge for you here?”** **Of course, when you get an answer, your Advice Monster will be screaming at you to come up with the perfect solution **– **but don’t. Instead, ask the person even more questions. Prod them into thinking for themselves about which actions they want to take. For example, you could say “What do you want?” or “If you're saying yes to this, what must you say no to?” 

A great way to end the conversation is to ask, “What was most useful or valuable here for you?” Giving someone the chance to formulate that for themselves is much more helpful than lecturing.

By starting to ask great questions, you nurture the most important quality you can have as a leader: curiosity. By taking the time to listen to the people around you, you give them the space to tune into their own inner wisdom, and build a sense of autonomy and purpose.

# People will do anything to try and avoid having a vulnerable conversation.

By asking questions, you’ll notice something important start to shift: instead of being ruled by your Advice Monster, you’ll begin to adopt a coaching habit – which means you’re more interested in helping to identify challenges than coming up with perfect answers.

But sometimes, in spite of your best efforts, you’ll get stuck in a conversation that’s not going anywhere. You ask the right questions, but you still can’t quite get to the heart of the challenge. That probably means you're confronting a** **“Foggy-fier.”** **Foggy-fiers are conversational traps that – much like fog – can hide what’s really going on. The good news is that the sooner you learn to spot them, the sooner you can blow them away.

**The key message here is: People will do anything to try and avoid having a vulnerable conversation.**

Sometimes, a conversation stays superficial because neither person wants to get vulnerable. So you settle for a safe topic that you both feel comfortable with, even though it’s not challenging.

Or the person you’re coaching could be unconsciously trying to distract you from what’s really going on. For example, they come into the session and talk nonstop about someone who’s irritating them. If you're not careful, you’ll miss the fact that you’ve been completely diverted into “coaching the ghost” – analyzing someone who’s not even in the room! If that happens, you need to gently pull the focus back, asking “Why does this matter to **you**?”

Or – sometimes – someone will come into a session with an overwhelming list of unrelated problems, leading you both to get completely befuddled – a phenomenon the author describes as “Popcorning.”** **In this instance, you should ask them to select the challenge they feel is the most important and start there.

Other distractions include talking in the abstract – what the author describes as “Big-Picturing.” Or launching into long, detailed stories that don’t go anywhere – what the author calls “Yarning.” Much as we all enjoy a good story or theoretical conversation, these tactics are problematic because they distract from the real, vulnerable work. As a coach you should gently draw attention to that, and once again ask a focusing question.

People use Foggy-fiers to avoid having challenging, vulnerable conversations. By asking probing questions, you give them the chance to identify their own blocks, and move the conversation to the next level. We’ll learn more about that in the next blink.

# To have transformative conversations, you need to make people feel safe.

The human brain is constantly alert, scanning the horizon for threats. When it feels like something destructive is coming, it triggers our survival mechanisms.

When we’re engaged in a challenging or uncomfortable conversation the same thing happens – the brain jumps into action, sounding the alert to activate these same survival modes. As a result, we either go into “fight" mode and become antagonistic or defensive, or we completely shut down – going into “freeze” mode.

Of course, these aren’t the kinds of reactions you want when you’re trying to have a difficult conversation with someone.

**The key message here is: To have transformative conversations, you need to make people feel safe.**

There are four important tactics you can use to make someone feel safe. The first is to be on their side. Be empathetic and mirror back what they’re saying with nods of encouragement and positive language. Use words like “us” and “we" to show that you’re on the same team, tackling the problem together. If someone feels supported, they’re much less likely to become defensive.

The second thing you can do is to show respect, by making it clear that you are of an equal **rank**. Human relationships involve a lot of power play, with people sizing each other up to figure out who is stronger. As a coach, you need to give up that need for power and control, and be vulnerable with the people you're coaching. Share your process and insecurities, and show them that you value their opinions just as much as – or even more than – your own.

Feeling like an equal will also give them a sense of autonomy, which is the third essential element in feeling safe. If people feel like they have a say in the process, they’ll be much more likely to open up.

Lastly, you should always manage expectations and never spring a surprise on someone, as that will instantly put them on edge. Introducing a structure for the session can also help put them at ease, as can assigning times for different tasks. 

By creating a safe, supportive environment, you’ll bypass the survival mechanisms that shut people down, and help them engage in the kinds of demanding, exciting conversations that will change their lives.

# To become a good coach you need to learn how to be coachable.

Even the most intrepid climber won’t scale Mount Everest in one go. He takes two steps back for every step forward, making sure to rest and acclimatize to the changing air pressure in between.

Taming your Advice Monster and developing your coaching mindset will be a similarly gradual process. You may feel like you’re making progress, and then slide right back into your old ways. It can be frustrating, but remember: you’re changing the habits of a lifetime! Of course it’ll take time to get it right.

**The key message here is: To become a good coach you need to learn how to be coachable.**

The best way to develop your coaching muscles is through practice. Coaching isn’t something that has to happen behind closed doors in a special session. You can use the key skills of listening and asking questions in every interaction you have. Ask your family open-ended questions about their day. Quiz your colleagues about how they think you can solve problems together. Grab every opportunity to be curious and expand your worldview.

Coaching doesn’t only have to happen face-to-face, either – it can happen over the phone, on Zoom and on Skype. And emails and texts are great places to flex your new skills, too. Allow the coaching mindset to seep into every aspect of your life.

But in order to keep learning, you should not only practice coaching, but also practice being coachable. That means asking for feedback on how you're doing, and trying to improve your performance wherever you can.

It also means getting your own coach. Being coached will help you identify your obstacles. How do you try to avoid the coaching process? What makes you feel vulnerable, and how do you deal with that? Getting in touch with these things will make you more effective in your work with other people because you’ll be more empathetic and understanding about what they're going through.

Learning to tame your Advice Monster is a lifelong task. But, like scaling Everest, the journey is just as important as the destination. Instead of beating yourself up for not getting there fast enough, relish the process and celebrate your willingness to learn and grow.

# Final summary

The key message in these blinks:

**Most of us go around compulsively giving out advice because we’ve internalized the idea that we can only add value to a situation if we have good solutions. But telling people what to do all the time backfires if it stops us listening to what they’re actually saying. Instead of blurting out advice, we need to master the art of asking probing questions. That way, we can identify what’s really challenging someone, and empower them to discover their own solutions. **

Actionable advice:

**Check if your advice has landed. **

Occasionally, you will be called on to give advice – which can be tricky when you’ve spent so much time trying to get away from it! But offering a thoughtful solution is different from giving a knee-jerk opinion. If you’re sure that your advice is needed, give it generously, making clear that this is just one approach to solving the problem. Once you’ve done that, check whether your advice has “landed” by confirming it was what the listener was actually looking for.
