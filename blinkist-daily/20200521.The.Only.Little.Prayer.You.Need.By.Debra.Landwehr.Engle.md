(2014) is a shortcut to living a more peaceful life. It explains how a short and simple prayer can help you relinquish your fears, renew your perspective on life, and free your mind.


# What’s in it for me? Shake yourself free from the shackles of fear.

Have you ever woken up in the middle of the night, soaked in sweat and gasping for breath, worrying about how you’ll pay off your mortgage this month, or whether you’ll get that promotion you’ve been working toward? That’s fear talking.

Author Debra Landwehr Engle knows this all too well. She too was a victim of what she calls “fear-based thoughts” until she found a simple, yet powerful, way to unburden herself from them. A short, six-word prayer, which she whispered to the Holy Spirit in her time of need, was all she needed to jumpstart her journey to greater peace of mind.

In these blinks, you’ll dive deep into what the prayer is, how it can be practiced in your daily life, and what benefits you can expect to see from saying it regularly. Don’t be put off if you’re not religious, though. The prayer is less about worshipping a deity or absolving yourself of sin, and more about finding peace and happiness.

Along the way, you’ll also learn

- how seemingly small events can jolt your perspective;
- the holistic benefits of making the prayer a daily practice; and
- how the prayer’s teachings can be applied to the real world.

# A simple prayer can change your life.

What if a single event could change your life forever? Author Debra Landwehr Engle experienced this firsthand when a seemingly unremarkable incident completely changed her perspective on life.

On a cold January day in 2013, Debra and her husband, Bob, went to pick up their car from the mechanic. After finishing the paperwork, Debra jumped into the car, started the ignition, and followed Bob as he drove to return the rental car they’d been using.

As she was driving, she began to notice a rattle in the dashboard. As the sound got louder and louder, she started to get annoyed. “Had the car not been repaired properly? What a waste of time,” she thought.

For the first time in her life, she became aware of all the negative thoughts whirling around 

in her brain like a typhoon. The problem was, she couldn’t make them stop.

She knew that she needed something to calm her thoughts – but, whatever it was, it couldn’t come from within her; it had to come from another power. She slunk down in the driver’s seat and found herself praying to the Holy Spirit with the words, “Please heal my fear-based thoughts.”

When Bob got back in the car for the drive home, something curious happened: the rattle in the dashboard had stopped. But how?

Debra thought back to the little prayer she had whispered in the driving seat, where she had asked for her fear-based thoughts to be healed, and realized what had happened: her** internal** perception had changed her **external **environment.

This was a life-changing moment for Debra. She discovered that when you ask for your thoughts to be healed, the external triggers that prompt those thoughts are no longer needed. So, the rattles go away.

Debra understood what self-help author Wayne Dyer had once pointed out: when you change the way you look at things, the things you look at begin to change.

With these realizations, Debra felt like she was onto something big: this small little prayer had the power to root out negative thoughts and shift her perspective from fear to love.

# Prayers usually ask for something in the external environment to change; this one is different. 

Have you ever prayed? If so, it may have gone something like this, “Please make my mother well,” or “Please keep my children safe.” In other words, you asked for something or someone in our **external** environment to change.

However, this prayer is different. Instead of asking for things to change in the world around you, you ask for **yourself **to be changed. Let’s look at how the prayer can be applied to a specific situation.

Take this prayer: “Please help me find the money to pay my mortgage this month.”

There’s nothing wrong with this prayer. In fact, saying it may even make you feel like the burden of that month’s mortgage payment has been lifted. However, this relief will only be temporary. Before long, your mind will start running away with itself, seeking out new worries like, “Even if I can pay my mortgage this month, what happens next month?”, and “What if my income dries up altogether?”

This is because the prayer doesn’t change anything in **you**. The result? You sink back into old patterns, recreating the problem in different iterations. It’s like climbing aboard a runaway train.

On the other hand, if you say the words “Please heal my fear-based thoughts about our mortgage,” it doesn’t just lift the burden of the problem temporarily, it relieves the need to recreate that fear and hold onto it. This prayer heals your desire for burdens – that is, your addiction to fear-based thoughts – liberating you to live a life without fear and with greater peace of mind.

That’s why the wording of the prayer is so important. The term “fear-based thoughts” helps us realize that, no matter how big our fears are, they’re just thoughts, and thoughts can be changed.

Ultimately, the prayer helps us with a little thing called perspective: you ask for yourself to be changed, knowing that the world around you will change as a result. 

# 

**“Fear doesn’t originate in the world outside you; it takes shape within your mind.”**

# Incorporate the prayer into your daily routine to maximize its benefits.

How long does it take to form a habit? And, what are the best ways of doing so? While the answers to these questions will be unique for everybody, the key is consistency – and this is true for the prayer as well.

That’s why you should try to find ways to incorporate it into your daily routine. For example, you could say the prayer as soon as you wake up in the morning, when you go to bed at night, or whenever you make a cup of tea or coffee.

However, while it’s necessary to be consistent, it’s important not to set a schedule for saying the prayer. In other words, don’t make the prayer just another thing to tick off your to-do list.

Also, it’s important to be patient with the results. When you first start saying the prayer, you may see some instant changes in your thoughts or external circumstances, or you may see none at all – but, stick with it. Let go of any expectations you may have and instead allow yourself to become a passive bystander, simply watching as things unfold before you.

And don’t give up before you fully give the prayer a try. You might get excited about the prayer at first and then experience a crash of enthusiasm. You may also find yourself coming up with any possible reason not to practice the prayer in your daily life.

For example, you may try your best to forget the prayer, ridicule yourself for saying it, or convince yourself that you simply don’t have enough time to incorporate it into your day. This is because you’ve become so used to being locked in fear-based thoughts that you’re scared to grow and find true happiness.

So, what can you do to overcome these obstacles and fully embrace the prayer?

Write it out and put it everywhere: tape it to your dashboard, stick it on your bathroom mirror, or place it next to your bed so it’s the first thing you see in the morning. One woman the author worked with even wrote the prayer down on dozens of strips of paper and pinned them all over her house.

The key takeaway? No matter what boulders your ego places in your path, just keep saying the prayer. In the following blink, we’ll take a closer look at just how this works.

# Saying the prayer connects you to your inner serenity.

Think back to when you were a child. Do you remember those cartoons where, as soon as a character has to make a decision, a devil and an angel pop up on either side of her shoulders?

Well, this is kind of like how our brains are set up. According to the online spiritual course **A Course in Miracles**, which the author teaches, our minds have two sides: the ego and the higher Self. 

The ego is like the devil on our shoulders. Fueled by fear, the ego is flighty, demanding, and prone to outbursts. The higher Self, on the other hand, is like an angel: calm, serene, and respectful. Comforted by the knowledge that we’re God’s children, it speaks to us in soft whispers and wraps us in divine love.

The problem is that our ego often overpowers our higher Self – making us scared, confused and unable to accept change. Why? Because it’s fed constantly by the fear in the world around us.

Fear is pervasive. It’s in the newspapers and on our TV screens as soon as we wake up in the morning – with headlines detailing terrorist attacks, the threat of natural disasters, and the growing concern for the environment.

It’s present inside us too, in the form of niggling insecurities – about the way we look and how others perceive us – and never-ending worries about money, our jobs, and our families.

However, it’s possible to nurture and develop your higher Self through things like meditation, self-reflection, spending time in nature, and any other pursuit that gives you the space to listen to the calming voice of your higher Self.

This is also where the prayer can help. The simple words “Please heal my fear-based thoughts” give you a moment of quiet every day to help you tap into the essence of who you are and the love you have inside you.

The reason why this prayer is so special is that it doesn’t demand that you eradicate your fear-based thoughts or emotions; it simply grants you the strength to shift them towards love-based ones – like acceptance, compassion, and forgiveness.

So, next time you’re approaching a situation and you feel the devil on your shoulder, say the prayer. It’ll help you realize that your worries and insecurities are just your fears talking. And, that you have the power to choose love instead.

# To heal your negative thoughts, you also need to learn what they are. 

Our world is filled with constant chatter – whether it’s the evening news on the car radio, a squabble between customers in the supermarket, or the whispers of gossip coming from the next office cubicle.

We also contribute to the noise ourselves. Remember that pesky rattle in the dashboard – the metaphor for those fear-based thoughts that we’re all immersed in? They contribute to what the author calls the “diet of drama” that we ingest on a daily basis without knowing it.

Though the prayer goes a long way in helping us heal our fear-based thoughts, we also need to figure out what these thoughts are in the first place. This involves tuning out of the external cacophony and paying attention to every negative thought that creeps into your mind.

Think of your mind like a garden: in order to keep it healthy, and allow other flowers to bloom, you have to pull the weeds out at their root.

So, how does this work in practice? Well, there are several techniques that can help you unpick the negative thoughts wriggling around in your psyche.

You could try journaling – simply sitting down with pen and paper for five to ten minutes and allowing your mind to download all of its thoughts – going for a walk, or taking out your headphones on your morning commute to help you pay attention to your thoughts.

It’s a good idea to check in with yourself at key times of the day, too. Ask yourself: “what are my thoughts in the morning and the last thing at night?”, or “what floats through my mind when I’m alone?”

As you do this, it’s important not to judge yourself for any negative thoughts you might have. Instead, imagine yourself looking at them from afar, as if you were watching a parade go by. Perhaps even say to yourself aloud: “Look at that – yet another fear-based thought about money.”

While you can’t silence the chatter of the outside world, you can train yourself to find peace within – and this is exactly what the prayer can help you do. By reserving a little slice of your day to ask for your thoughts to be healed, you give yourself the opportunity to dismiss negative thinking and start again with a clean slate.

# The prayer helps you accept the things you can’t change.

For many people, the idea of getting fired, having a chronic health condition or losing a relative would be enough to send them into complete despair – and for good reason. But, what if it were possible to face those challenges all at once and still remain calm?

This was the case for Shelley, a woman who attended one of the author’s workshops on the day she had lost her corporate job.

Shelley had been dealing with a host of problems for a while. For starters, her boss had been trying to intimidate her into quitting her job for several months, and she knew it. While getting fired was somewhat of a relief, she had to face financial worries.

While this was going on, Shelley and her husband were trying to sell their house, but they soon realized it was impossible: they discovered that their bungalow had severe structural problems that would cost far more to repair than the house itself was worth.

Not only that, but Shelley’s mother was expecting to move in with her due to unexpected changes in her own living situation. And, Shelley was struggling with the effects of Graves disease, an autoimmune disorder that affects the thyroid and zaps your energy.

Still, Shelley sat in the workshop hosted by the author with a smile on her face. People asked her how she managed to remain so calm in the face all of the curveballs life was throwing at her. Her answer? She said the prayer on an hourly basis, even minute to minute, to remind her of her strength to overcome her problems.

In the past, fear had been Shelley’s lifeblood. But, once she slowed down, took a step back from the chaos, and trusted in the prayer to heal her fear-based thoughts she began to find peace. She even found herself more willing to embrace new opportunities, such as starting her own business – something that she would never have dreamed of doing before.

Shelley is still dealing with challenges, but the prayer has helped her revise the **way **she’s dealing with them. The biggest difference? The external events in her life no longer have power over her.

Saying the prayer isn’t about going into denial. It’s about freeing yourself from worrying about the things you can’t change.

# The prayer helps you make small advances toward greater global happiness.

We all have an idea of what our perfect lives would look like – whether it’s living in a nice house, having a family, hopping on and off planes to witness the wonders of the world or a combination of them all. But, aside from this, most of us just want to be happy.

The word “happiness,” however, is hard to define and it’s a concept that, surprisingly, not everyone feels totally comfortable with.

For example, at a recent women’s spirituality workshop hosted by the author, she asked the participants, “Are you as happy as you want to be?” Several women balked at the word “happy” as it sounded overused and superficial, and preferred to use words like “peaceful” or “joyful.”

At the end of the workshop, the participants made the following conclusion about happiness: it brings freedom, forgiveness, fulfillment – as well as greater peace of mind to our lives. However, being happy doesn’t necessarily mean that you’ll always be jumping for joy. It just means that you feel safe and supported by the world around you.

For the author, happiness is the absence of fear and the feeling of pure, uncorrupted love. It’s something that we all search for regardless of our race, religion, gender, sexuality, or culture.

A question that the author is often asked by people who have benefitted from the prayer is whether it can help the world as a **whole **achieve greater happiness. For example, does it have the power to solve pressing problems such as violence, poverty, famine, and corruption?

Let’s return to our story about Shelley. Once she started using the prayer, and became more peaceful as a result, she realized how it positively influenced her family too. All of a sudden, people close to her began to approach their problems with patience and acceptance, freeing themselves from fear-based thoughts that would usually prevent them from achieving their goals.

While the prayer can’t dismantle hierarchies or end bloodshed, it can help us make small changes to achieve greater peace. If each of us strives to be kinder and more accepting to one another, it’ll send ripples out into the world, encouraging others to follow in our example.

**“The prayer is revolutionary, because it not only heals us, it heals the world.”**

# Final summary

The key message in these blinks:

**All of us have moments where life feels overwhelming. In between meeting the demands of work, family and our own high standards, fear-based thoughts can creep in – and, our attempts to bat them away can feel like trying to sweep the ocean away with a broom. One simple prayer – “****Please heal my fear-based thoughts” –**** can help you build resilience and find space in the chaos. It can also help you understand that sometimes you don’t need to fix the problem, you just need to have your thoughts about the problem healed. Saying this prayer puts you, and the world around you, on the path to greater peace of mind.**

Actionable advice:

**Recognize the onset of fear-based thoughts.**

Have you ever had something in mind that you keep putting off – like writing a book, losing weight, or working on a side-hustle? And, have you ever said the words, “I’ve been busy, so I haven’t gotten to it yet?” over and over again? If so, it’s probably because you have fear in the way. If you find yourself saying these words, stop, and say aloud “I’m **going **to do it.” This will help you notice and hold yourself accountable for any negative thoughts that are trying to creep in.
