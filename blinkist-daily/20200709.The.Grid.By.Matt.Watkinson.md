(2017) identifies a set of factors that can make or break businesses. Rooted in a holistic approach, these blinks will help you evaluate business ideas, anticipate the impact of your decisions, and take advantage of changes in the market. Apply these principles in your own company, and you’ll be able to identify the true causes of problems rather than simply treating the symptoms. 


# What’s in it for me? A holistic approach to business. 

How likely is it that my start-up idea will succeed? What can I do to make my business more profitable? How will changes in my department affect the rest of the company? 

These are just some of the questions that entrepreneurs, managers, and department heads ask themselves every day. The answers to these questions tend to be highly specific to individual companies. What works in one context doesn’t necessarily work in another. 

But what if there were a methodology anyone could apply to **their **business at any time? 

Well, there is! Let’s dive in and find out what it is and what it can do for you and your business.

Along the way, you’ll learn: 

- what businesses and the human body have in common; 
- why raising your prices boosts profits more effectively than increasing production; and 
- how outsourcing can undermine your bargaining power. 

# Businesses are like human bodies – they thrive when you treat them holistically. 

If you’re open-minded and pay attention to what’s happening around you, you can discover important truths in the most unlikely situations. Take it from the author. One of the most impactful lessons about business he’s had in his life came from something deeply personal: his chronic knee pain. 

He visited specialist after specialist, but none of them seemed able to cure his pain. There was a good reason for that – they were focused on treating his symptoms, not the underlying cause. Finally, after months of pain, the author agreed to surgery on both knees. But even this drastic measure brought no relief. His knees continued to make his life hell. 

Six months after this surgery, he decided to try a different approach. He talked to physiotherapists and osteopaths and spent hours on foam rollers, but that didn’t help either. Then, just as he was about to call it quits and resign himself to a life of chronic pain, he met a sports rehabilitation expert called Nicole Parsons. 

Unlike other specialists, Parsons didn’t just look at the author’s knees – she examined his whole body. It was this holistic approach that revealed the true cause of the problem: a muscle imbalance between his shoulders and his toes that knocked his hips out of alignment and placed extra pressure on his knees. 

Having found the true cause of the author’s issues, Parsons was able to prescribe an effective remedy. After the author put in a couple of months’ work strengthening the rest of his body, his knees were no longer causing him pain, and he was able to start jogging again. 

Now, these blinks aren’t about holistic medicine, but this example is deeply relevant when it comes to business. For a long time, there just weren’t any coaches specializing in the business equivalent of Parson’s holistic approach to sports injuries. Sure, there were plenty of experts who could tell you how to fix individual parts of a struggling business, but hardly anyone looked at the whole picture. 

That’s a shame, because, just like human bodies, businesses thrive when you solve problems by looking at how different parts fit together and interact. That means it’s time to take a different approach to struggling businesses. In the following blinks, we’ll give you a tool to help you do just that. 

Ready? Great, let’s find out about what the author calls **the Grid** – a holistic business analysis that sets out three goals, three factors, and nine elements applicable to all companies. 

# Desirability, profitability, and longevity make for a successful business.

Right, let’s begin sketching the Grid. The best place to start is by setting our ultimate goals. These can be described in all sorts of ways, but when you really get down to it, all businesses share three identical goals.

First off, each and every business must be **desirable**. Put differently, if you want your company to prosper, you need people to be interested in your product. 

Second: **profitability**. It’s not enough for people to be interested in what you’re selling – they must be interested enough to pay an amount that will allow you to stay in business. 

Finally, businesses must have **longevity**. There are two reasons for this. Firstly, the longer your business exists, the more profit you’ll generate. Secondly, the longer you’ve been around, the more customers will trust you. Conversely, when you’re a very young company, it’s extremely hard to convince folks to buy your product. 

These three goals – desirability, profitability, and longevity – are interconnected. This means that you cannot have one without the others. A product that is desirable but unprofitable, for example, is unsustainable. If a product isn’t desirable, by contrast, it won’t be profitable. And a product that is neither profitable nor desirable will not have longevity. 

Take an upmarket wheelchair company the author worked with a couple of years back to see how this plays out in practice. This company’s research suggested that there was a lot of demand for well-designed, sleek wheelchairs. But here’s where things went wrong. Rather than focusing on all three goals, it obsessed over one quality – desirability. In its quest for perfection, the company settled on carbon fiber as its material of choice. 

Only one firm produced the kind of carbon fiber needed, however, and so the wheelchair company had no bartering power and ended up spending huge amounts of cash on materials. These costs were then passed on to consumers, who were now asked to pay as much for a wheelchair as they would for a small car. This was neither profitable nor sustainable, and the company went bust. 

As you can see, considering these three goals at every stage of your process is vital. To do this effectively, though, you’ll also need to take three factors into account. Let’s find out what those are in the next blink. 

# Business is unreliable, and customers, markets, and your organization are always changing.

Imagine a ship at sea. The currents pull it one way; the winds blow it another. To maintain its course, it must take these factors into account and adjust its sails accordingly. This, then, is the mark of a well-run ship: the captain and crew know the currents and listen to the wind.

Businesses are a bit like ships in that they are also buffeted by forces beyond their control, which they must learn to navigate. The three most important factors they must consider are their customers, their organization, and the market. These are all highly unpredictable.

Let’s start with customers. Their needs and desires change all the time. Say parking becomes more expensive in a city. Suddenly, people don’t want to own a car of their own – they want to rent vehicles by the minute or the hour. 

The strengths and weaknesses of an organization are just as changeable. A start-up with five employees can quickly morph into a small corporation with a hundred employees. The start-up might have had less cash, but the larger organization will probably be a whole lot less flexible. 

Then there’s the market, which is famously fickle. From one day to the next, companies can suddenly find themselves confronted by new competitors or struggling to conform to new regulations. 

Failing to navigate these three factors can produce catastrophic results. Take it from the German carmaker Volkswagen. In 2015, the company admitted it had used software in its diesel engines to cheat on emissions tests, causing an international scandal. 

So why did Volkswagen cheat? Well, in the early 2000s, it decided to reject the hybrid model approach and develop “clean diesel” cars instead. These were supposed to provide a combination of low emissions, high fuel economy, and strong performance. In 2008 Volkswagen realized that its cars couldn’t meet American pollution standards and were therefore uncompetitive. Cheating, its directors concluded, was the only alternative to launching an uncompetitive product. 

The fallout was massive. When the truth came out, Volkswagen had to create an $18 billion emergency fund to salvage the company’s reputation.

This is a great example of why it’s so important to navigate change. When deciding in favor of a clean diesel model, Volkswagen focused on making a desirable product without considering the trend toward increasing pollution standards. And by cheating, it focused on short-term profit and neglected its long-term reputation among customers. 

# The desirability of a product is determined by three important elements.

In this blink, we’ll be shifting gears and looking more closely at what makes a company desirable. This will add three more elements to our grid – **wants and needs**, **rivalry**, and **offerings**. 

Let’s start with **wants and needs**. In general, these are determined by customers’ values and beliefs. These aren’t written in stone, however. In fact, the beliefs and values guiding customers are constantly changing. 

Take the diamond industry. In the 1930s, diamond sales were down, and the entire sector was struggling. That’s when the diamond company De Beers launched an advertising campaign that suggested that a man’s love was reflected by the size of the diamond he gifted his darling. 

The campaign was a stunning success and transformed America’s perception of diamonds. Suddenly, diamonds were synonymous with eternal love. This new idea gradually rippled outward into the wider world, too. In Japan, for example, just 5 percent of men proposed with a diamond back in 1967. By 1981, it was 60 percent!

The desirability of a product also depends on what alternatives **rivals** in a specific market are selling. Alternatives often become available when the entry barriers** **– anything hindering access** **to a market – change. 

Think of Airbnb. Hotels have to own or lease property, pay staff, and comply with regulations. Airbnb, by contrast, doesn’t have any of these costs or compliance concerns. Put differently, by removing these entry barriers, it has been able to flood the market with cheaper – and thus more desirable – accommodation and beat out its old-school rivals. 

That brings us to the third factor – **offerings**. This is all about giving customers a good experience, which, in turn, makes your product desirable. To do that, you have to understand how your customers identify themselves. 

Coca-Cola took this idea literally in its “Share a Coke” campaign, replacing the brand’s usual logo with ordinary names like Dave and Sarah. The result? Coke-Cola shifted 150 million bottles, racked up 998 million impressions on Twitter, and sold 730,000 glass bottles in the United Kingdom alone. 

That just goes to show the importance of desirability. But that’s only a means to another goal – **profitability**, the subject we’ll be tackling in the next blink.

# 

**“People do not build their beliefs on a foundation of reason. They begin with certain beliefs, then find reasons to justify them.” **– Hungarian physicist Eugene P. Wigner.

# Profitability is achieved by increasing revenue, preserving bargaining power, and cutting costs. 

It’s time to look at profitability. Like desirability, this can be broken into three factors, each of which we’ll be adding to the Grid. 

Let’s start with **price**. Simply put, raising the price of a given product is one of the most effective ways of boosting your revenue. Take it from McKinsey. In a 2010 study, the management consultancy firm found that a 1 percent price hike increased profits by 11 percent if demand remained constant. 

If that sounds a little abstract, imagine a candle business. Each candle it makes costs $8 to produce and is sold for $10, leaving the company with a $2 profit per candle. Selling one million candles at this price would thus generate $2 million of profit. 

But what if the company raised its prices and began selling candles at $10.10 per unit? Well, its profits would increase by $100,000. If it decided to increase its volume by 1 percent, however, and sell 1,010,000 candles instead of 1,000,000, it would only increase its profits by $20,000. The reason for this is simple: when you increase the volume, your material costs also rise, meaning you have to make more to sell more. When you raise your price, by comparison, your material costs remain the same. 

The second factor is **bargaining power**. You can see how this works by taking Apple as an example. When it introduced its music streaming service, Apple Music, it offered a three-month free trial. When it became clear that musicians would not receive royalties during these three months, Taylor Swift sent an open letter to Apple refusing to release her album on the service. 

Within 24 hours, Apple had changed its policy. To preserve its bargaining power, Apple wisely decided to protect its reputation and make a powerful ally in Taylor Swift. 

That brings us to the third and final factor – keeping costs down by setting **stringent targets**. 

Consider the rocket business SpaceX. Aiming to keep their prices down, founder Elon Musk created detailed spreadsheets to estimate the lowest possible costs to maximize profit and implemented a policy that he personally had to sign off on every payment over $10,000. 

This stringent approach paid off, and the company beat its $5,000 target for building a part to steer its rockets. To put that into perspective, a supplier had initially estimated a cost of $120,000!

# If you’re in it for the long haul, protect your customer base, keep your originality, and stay adaptable. 

Now that we’ve covered desirability and profitability, we’ll need to look at the factors that determine a company’s longevity. This will allow us to add another three elements to our grid – **customer base**, **imitability**, and **adaptability**. 

Let’s start with the **customer base**. It’s an ironclad rule of business that a company cannot survive if consumers don’t know it exists. Longevity, in other words, depends on awareness. 

Take it from Marc Barros, the founder of a company called Contour. Never heard of it? Well, that’s kind of the point. Back in 2004, Contour was one of two firms developing wearable cameras for action sports. The other was GoPro. Whereas Contour obsessed over building the best product, GoPro focused on marketing. The former went bust while the latter went on to make billions. 

As Barros later put it, the hard lesson this had taught him was that “the best product doesn’t always win, the product everyone knows about does.” 

That said, longevity **does **depend on the nature of a business’ products – to a certain extent, at least. The more original, or the less **imitable**, a product is, the greater the longevity of its producer. This doesn’t mean you should try to patent your product, however. Usually, trade secrets are much more effective at preventing imitation. 

This is because legal patents are expensive and expire. Trade secrets, by contrast, cost nothing and last indefinitely. Better yet, they can be enforced by non-disclosure agreements. When a Ferrari engineer shared a trade secret with one of the company’s main rivals, McLaren, Ferrari successfully brought claims against McLaren in Italy and Britain, and the latter was fined over $100 million. 

The third factor that influences longevity is **adaptability** – the ability to stay one step ahead of your competitors. This is especially important in an age in which technology, regulations, and consumer needs are constantly changing. Today, no product is timeless, and only the most innovative companies thrive. 

A good example of one of these companies is Framestore, which creates visual effects for movies like **Gravity**. Since its founding in 1986, Framestore has consistently pushed the envelope. As a result, it was able to move from visual effects into advertising and create pioneering motion-capture facilities as well as being one of the first companies to open a virtual-reality studio. By staying tuned-in to technological developments, in other words, the company has remained adaptable and increased its longevity.

# Business success materializes through all nine elements of the Grid.

We’ve now defined the three goals, three factors, and nine elements that apply to all companies. But remember what we said at the start – these can’t be treated in isolation. Every element is relevant and can affect changes in every other element. 

Let’s say a company has a brilliant idea for a new product, but it fails to take account of the expertise of rival companies. The danger here is that the first company develops a product that a competitor then easily copies and even improves. This happens when companies focus on the desirability of products from the perspective of consumers but forget about rivals. 

Alternatively, imagine developing a product that may not exist on the market and that doesn’t fit customers’ wants and needs. The super-expensive carbon fiber wheelchairs we discussed in an earlier blink are a good example of such a product. Here we have a business that considered some elements of the Grid – rivalry and the market – but failed to account for others, such as customer needs. 

It’s also important to note how changes in one element can have a knock-on effect on others. Considered in isolation, for example, outsourcing looks like a great idea – after all, it saves on costs and increases profits. Look more closely, though, and it quickly becomes clear that it can also decrease a firm’s bargaining power, which, in turn, makes it easier for rivals to muscle in on this market. 

This is exactly what happened to the computer company Dell. Hoping to cut its costs, Dell outsourced much of its production to a Taiwanese supplier called Asus. Initially, Asus produced motherboards but, soon enough, it was responsible for all of Dell’s assembly work. 

In the short run, this move boosted Dell’s profits, but then Asus used its knowledge of Dell’s products to launch its own line of computers. By the time Dell saw Asus in the rear mirror, it was too late – the Taiwanese company was already overtaking its American counterpart. Outsourcing, in other words, made Dell imitable and cost it its bargaining power, thus facilitating the emergence of a powerful rival. 

Right, now that we’ve set out the Grid and identified its elements, it’s time to show you how you can apply the Grid to a struggling business. 

# You may need a second pair of eyes to start improving your business with the Grid. 

The author was recently engaged by a company in the service sector that had run into financial difficulties. When he looked at the firm’s data, he found some puzzling patterns. Customer satisfaction was high, for example, but repeat purchases were low. The firm also had a lot of potential customers, but very few of them committed to a purchase. So what was going on here?

Well, here are a couple of things the author learned from this example. Let’s start with one of the most obvious lessons: sometimes, you simply need a fresh pair of eyes to identify improvements. 

Take the issue of low repeat purchases. When the author asked around, he discovered that the company was selling one-off projects and didn’t offer continuous service. No wonder customers weren’t coming back – they weren’t being asked to return! No one, however, had noticed this until the author pointed it out. And when the company implemented a biannual check-up service that developed ongoing relationships with customers, it noticed big returns. 

That brings us to the second lesson: don’t always trust your instincts because issues often arise in unexpected ways. Think of the problem this company was having with revenue. It would have made intuitive sense to conclude that the firm needed to focus on raising awareness. That, though, could easily have led to costly – and wasteful – marketing measures. Awareness, it turned out, wasn’t the real issue. 

As the author discovered, there were a lot of potential customers out there – the key was finding a way to get them to commit to the company. This, in turn, suggested that there might be something amiss with the customer experience. 

Reviewing the proposals made by the firm to potential clients, the author found that the proposals were incredibly technical, completely inaccessible, and failed to set out the benefits of the service. He therefore advised the firm to improve its proposals, which was both less expensive and reaped greater benefits. 

That just goes to show how the Grid can help you turn around a struggling business! 

# Final summary

The key message in these blinks:

**The success of every business depends on nine interdependent factors. This means that you’ll need to consider your company’s strategy from multiple points of view. Looking at it from your customer’s perspective, for example, you should consider their needs and desires and the cost of your product. When it comes to development, by contrast, you’ll need to consider how imitable your products are and what your rivals are offering. Cover all nine of these bases, and you’ll be well on your way to success. **

Actionable advice:

**Don’t base your price on your costs. **

Remember, your customers don’t care how much **you **have to pay to create a product – all they care about is how valuable it is to **them**. This is a simple but profoundly important point because it tells you how to set your prices. Fix the price of your product to your own costs, and you’ll be in trouble; set it according to the value your customers attribute to the product, and it’ll fly off the shelves.
