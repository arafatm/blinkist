(2004) is an insider’s account of imperialism in the modern age. Drawing on the experiences of John Perkins, a consultant who spent decades working behind the scenes to further America’s interests, these blinks shed light on how the United States uses debt to manipulate and control smaller nations. 


# What’s in it for me? Uncover the secrets of American foreign policy. 

How do you get rid of bothersome rulers and keep supposedly independent countries and their resources under your control without sending in the Marines? 

This was a question that preoccupied American strategists in the early years of the Cold War. By the 1960s, they had an answer. They would use so-called “Economic Hit Men,” or EHMs – private-sector contractors who did the dirty work necessary to keep countries aligned with the United States. 

In these blinks, we’ll delve into this murky world as we follow the life of John Perkins, a young Peace Corps volunteer who was recruited in Ecuador and molded into an EHM back in the US. Along the way, we’ll explore the operations he was involved in and see how these reflected shifting American foreign policy goals. 

You’ll also learn 

- what dominoes have to do with the spread of Communism;
- how conditional loans ensure the loyalty of nations like Indonesia; and 
- why American strategists became obsessed with Saudi Arabia in the 1970s.

# A covert operation in Iran in the 1950s provided a template for American foreign policy, but it needed tweaking.

Throughout history, empires have relied on military force. If they wanted to control a territory, they dispatched their armies and seized it. Rivals might dispute these claims, and this might lead to war, but that was rarely a deterrence. Conflict was simply an unavoidable cost of doing imperial business. 

This calculation changed after World War II. Now, as older European powers waned, two new empires emerged – the Soviet Union and the United States. Both possessed the atomic bomb, which meant that war between them was likely to end in nuclear armageddon. That **was **a deterrence, and it led the US to develop a new approach to imperial management. 

**The key message here is: A covert operation in Iran in the 1950s provided a template for American foreign policy, but it needed tweaking.**

In 1951, the Iranians elected Mohammad Mosaddegh, a popular nationalist who promised to return control of the nation’s vast oil reserves to its people. In March 1953, he made good on this pledge and nationalized the British company that controlled Iran’s oil – APOC, or the Anglo-Persian Oil Company. 

Washington was appalled. A trusted ally had lost control of a vital strategic resource, and Mosaddegh had set an example other countries were sure to follow. Getting rid of Mosaddegh was tricky, though. If the US invaded Iran, the Soviet Union might retaliate. That left just one option:** **a covert operation. 

It was led by CIA agent Kermit Roosevelt. A master of the dark arts of subversion, Roosevelt instigated riots and anti-government protests, making Iran practically ungovernable. This chaos was the perfect pretext for a coup. In August 1953, Mosaddegh was removed from office and replaced by a pro-Western government that quickly returned control of Iran’s oil to APOC. 

American strategists were delighted. They had overthrown a troublesome government without firing a single shot. In the process, they had created a template for covert interference that would be used time and again in the coming years. There was, however, one loose end. 

Roosevelt was a CIA employee. If he’d been caught, the US would have been implicated in the coup. That would have invited Soviet retaliation and risked a catastrophic war. What strategists now realized was that they needed plausible deniability. As we’ll see later on, they also realized that the best way of achieving this was to outsource covert operations to the private sector. 

# Dodging the draft led Perkins down an unexpected path. 

Iran wasn’t the only country keeping American strategists up at night in the 1950s. In Vietnam, an anti-colonial insurgency had attracted the support of the Soviets. Washington didn’t want to prop up France’s crumbling empire, but the threat of a Communist takeover forced its hand. 

Money, guns, and advisors started flowing into Vietnam. It wasn’t enough; France was defeated. The US upped the ante and deployed its own combat troops in 1965. Suddenly, millions of young American men faced being drafted. The author, John Perkins – a 20-year-old high school graduate from a conservative family in New Hampshire – was one of them. 

An instinctive rebel, he was desperate to avoid being sent to Vietnam to fight an enemy whose cause he thought was just. Ironically, his attempts to evade the draft would lead him to become a dedicated servant of American power. 

**The key message in this blink is: Dodging the draft led Perkins down an unexpected path. **

There were a couple of ways to dodge the draft in the sixties. Radicals simply skipped town and fled to Canada. If you wanted to stay on the right side of the law, you had another option – college. This was only a temporary reprieve, though. Students couldn’t be enlisted, but graduates below the age of 26 could. 

Perkins enrolled in a three-year course at Boston University in 1965. After being found fit for service in 1967, he scrambled to line up a job that would keep him out of Vietnam. Luckily, he had connections. Frank, a friend of the family, worked for the National Security Agency. Frank pulled some strings and got him an interview. He landed the job; he was safe. Like students, government workers couldn’t be drafted. 

But before he could start at the Agency, he had to finish his studies. During his final year he attended a Peace Corps seminar, where he learned two interesting facts. One: volunteers for this government-run program were exempt from the draft. Two: the Corps needed volunteers in the Amazon. Desk job or jungle adventure – it was an easy choice. He signed up on the spot. 

He called Frank to tell him the news, expecting him to be disappointed. He wasn’t. Vietnam, Frank said, was going to fall to the Communists. American attention would turn to the Amazon and its untapped oil reserves. Plenty of people, he added cryptically, were going to be interested in hiring someone who knew his way around the area.

# Perkins landed a job as an economic forecaster after being headhunted by a consultancy. 

Perkins arrived in Ecuador in September 1968. Straddling the Andes and some of the world’s most formidable jungles, Ecuador’s mountain streams form the headwaters of the Amazon. It was here, on the banks of this mighty river, that Perkins began his work as a Peace Corps volunteer. 

Until now, he had only met members of Latin America’s elite – wealthy families who sent their sons and daughters to study in the US. Now, he was living with the Shuar, an indigenous people who, like their ancestors thousands of years ago, foraged and hunted their food. 

It was an enchanting time, but it wouldn’t last. Before he could lose himself in the jungle, a representative of the modern world came knocking. He had an offer. 

**The key message in this blink is: Perkins landed a job as an economic forecaster after being headhunted by a consultancy. **

Einar Greve’s freshly pressed suit stood out like a sore thumb when Perkins first met him in 1969. It was clear he didn’t spend much time in the jungle, so why was he here? Greve told him. 

He was the vice president of Chas T. Main Inc., or MAIN for short, a consultancy that worked with international organizations like the World Bank. Ecuador’s cash-strapped government wanted to construct hydroelectric dams. To do that, it needed to borrow money. Before approving a billion-dollar loan, the World Bank wanted to know if this was a sound investment. 

Greve was looking for a trustworthy informant inside Ecuador. He knew Perkins had been offered a job at the NSA, so he was inclined to trust him – but could he also provide useful data? Before leaving, Greve asked him to send regular updates about Ecuador’s prospects. Perkins rose to the challenge, sending 15 detailed appraisals of the country’s economic situation over the following year. 

His work impressed Greve. MAIN had hired three economists to provide forecasts for its principal client, the World Bank, but they had all struggled with the rigors of gathering data in out-of-the-way places with little official support. One of them had even had a nervous breakdown in a remote Panamanian village.  

The author’s time in rural Ecuador and his data-packed letters showed that he was ideally suited to this kind of work. In early 1971, he joined MAIN as an economic forecaster. This was his official title; unofficially, he would play a very different role…

# 

**“Einar had hired me as an economist, but I was soon to learn that my real job went far beyond that.”**

# A mysterious consultant revealed the true nature of MAIN’s work. 

Two types of people worked for MAIN: engineers and ex-military men. The odd thing about this was that the company had never constructed so much as a storage shed. It didn’t work with the Department of Defense or the Army, either. So what did MAIN actually do?  

This question bothered Perkins. He’d been with the company for a few months now and had handed in a couple of carefully compiled reports. It was solid work, but it hadn’t hit the mark. Colleagues began hinting that getting on at MAIN was all about finding the **right **kind of data. 

What did **that** mean? He was about to find out. 

**The key message in this blink is: A mysterious consultant revealed the true nature of MAIN’s work. **

Perkins had spent weeks trying to track down elusive figures on oil production in Kuwait. He had all but given up when a woman took a seat next to him in MAIN’s foyer and handed him a folder. She watched with amusement as his face lit up; it contained everything he needed.

He had just met Claudine Martin, the MAIN consultant who would complete his training. 

Martin began by stating that she would mold him into an “Economic Hit Man,” or EHM, over the coming weeks. Once she was done, he would have a decision to make.  

EHMs, Martin said, have two functions. Firstly, they create economic forecasts that justify huge loans to finance construction projects in countries like Ecuador. Forget accuracy – statistics can always be manipulated, after all. The aim is to create opportunities for MAIN, which makes its money by acting as an intermediary between governments and construction companies.  

Secondly, EHMs bankrupt the nations that receive these loans. Indebted states are beholden to their creditors – organizations like the World Bank, which are largely funded by and closely aligned with the US. This comes in handy when Washington needs a favor like, say, a vote in the UN or permission to build a new military base. 

In return for this dirty work, Perkins could expect two things from MAIN. The first was enough money to ensure he never wanted for anything again. The second was a jet-setting life of luxury and intrigue. 

So, was he in or out? It was an easy question for an ambitious 26-year-old. 

He was in. 

# Perkins’s first mission was to provide dodgy data justifying huge loans to Indonesia. 

A simple yet compelling idea drove American involvement in Vietnam – the idea that if one country falls to Communism, its neighbors will follow just as surely as one falling domino topples the next. In Asia, China had been followed by North Korea; if Vietnam fell, there was no telling who was next. 

By 1971, however, strategists were convinced it was too late to save Vietnam. Their gaze shifted to the next domino – Indonesia, an oil-rich archipelago of 17,500 islands. Keeping Indonesia open for business and friendly with the US wasn’t a military matter, though. This mission would be left to the EHMs. 

**The key message here is: Perkins’s first mission was to provide dodgy data justifying huge loans to Indonesia. **

The Indonesian domino had already wobbled a few times. After declaring independence in 1945, a fiery anti-imperialist called Sukarno came to power. He aligned Indonesia with the Soviet bloc and protected the powerful Communist Party of Indonesia.

The Army put an end to this alliance in 1965, rounding up and massacring hundreds of thousands of Communists. In 1967, it deposed Sukarno and installed a general from its own ranks as president. The US breathed a sigh of relief; Indonesia had been saved from Communism. Now, it needed to secure the new regime’s loyalty. 

With this objective in mind, the World Bank and the US Agency for International Development, or USAID, committed to lending Indonesia billions of dollars for infrastructure projects. These loans wouldn’t just leave Indonesia indebted to the US – they would also make American corporations very rich. 

How? Well, the loans would be conditional. The Indonesian government had to make two commitments. First off, it would agree to hire American contractors and pay them whatever they asked. Secondly, it would prioritize projects that facilitated the extraction and exportation of the country’s largely untapped oil reserves.

Indonesia’s would-be creditors needed plausible data showing that these loans made economic sense before they could go ahead with this plan, though. In the summer of 1971, MAIN sent the author to Indonesia. He was part of an eleven-man team tasked with evaluating a plan to construct an electricity grid that would facilitate oil extraction in Java, Indonesia’s largest island. 

His job was exactly what Claudine Martin had told him it would be – massaging statistical data until it showed what his employers wanted it to show. It was his first test.

# Despite misgivings, Perkins fudged the figures needed to approve loans to Indonesia.

The World Bank and USAID would only approve loans to Indonesia if it could be shown that the electrification of Java contributed to the growth of the country’s economy. Without a favorable forecast, the projects would be put on ice. For MAIN, that was an unacceptable outcome. 

It expected growth projections from Perkins – the higher, the better. This was the job he’d been trained to do, but the longer he stayed in Indonesia, the more he questioned his mission. 

**The key message in this blink is: Despite misgivings, Perkins fudged the figures needed to approve loans to Indonesia.**

Few of MAIN’s employees saw themselves as conspirators. There was a simple reason for that: they believed in an idea that justified their work, however shady it might appear. 

The idea was that all economic growth benefits humankind, and more growth creates more benefits. There was just one problem with this notion as far as the author was concerned: it wasn’t true. 

Take Indonesia’s capital, Jakarta. Filled with lush gardens, tropical flowers, bright sarongs, and the scent of cloves, it was often a very beautiful city. But it also had an ugly and tragic side. Lepers with bloodied stumps for hands begged in the streets. Young girls sold their bodies for a pittance. The majestic canals built by the Dutch, Indonesia’s old colonial masters, were filled with trash and lined with cardboard hovels, the homes of Jakarta’s poor. 

Electrification **would** bring growth, but that growth wasn’t going to help these people – it would simply line the pockets of the elites who controlled the newly efficient oil industry. 

Despite this gloomy conclusion, Perkins decided to give his bosses what they wanted. His report concluded that electrifying Java would boost economic growth by 17 percent annually, a wildly exaggerated figure. 

He justified this to himself by reasoning that his projection would be rejected anyway. His team included another forecaster, a gruff 70-year-old called Parker who refused to tow the company line. He knew Parker’s more accurate estimate was just 7 percent and assumed MAIN would be forced to accept this figure – Parker, after all, was the more senior economist. 

It was a clever justification, but it didn’t play out that way. MAIN fired Parker, promoted Perkins to chief economist, and then used his forecast. 

The loans were approved.

**“In many countries economic growth benefits only a small portion of the population and may in fact result in increasingly desperate circumstances for the majority.”**

# The US embraced Saudi Arabia after the 1973 oil embargo.

The global economic outlook was positive when Perkins was appointed chief economist at MAIN in 1972. His job, it seemed, would be to guide the company through a period of unspectacular yet steady growth. 

Then, on October 6, 1973, everything changed. Egyptian and Syrian forces launched an attack on Israel, triggering the October War. The US rushed to Israel’s defense. Outraged, Egypt’s president, Anwar Sadat, urged Arab and Muslim countries sympathetic to his nation’s cause to make use of the “oil weapon.”

On October 16, six states, including Saudi Arabia, announced a 70 percent increase in the price of oil. When President Nixon asked Congress for $2.2 billion in aid for Israel three days later, they went even further, imposing a total oil embargo on the US. 

It was a historic decision, and it transformed America’s strategic thinking forever.

**The key message in this blink is: The US embraced Saudi Arabia after the 1973 oil embargo.**

The embargo lasted until March 8, 1974. Its impact was immense. On January 1, 1970, Saudi oil cost $1.39 a barrel. Four years later, it was being traded at $8.32 a barrel. In the US, this sudden price surge threatened to make a vital industrial input all but unaffordable. The economy came to a grinding halt, and the country was pushed to the brink of a second Great Depression. 

The embargo was lifted in time to prevent this, but it was a trauma American leaders would never forget. Washington and Wall Street were determined to do everything in their power to prevent this from ever happening again. As we’ve already seen, protecting America’s access to oil had long been a strategic concern. After the embargo, it became more than that – it became an obsession. 

The other side of the equation was Saudi Arabia. A small player in international politics before 1973, it suddenly became a key piece on the global chessboard. From now on, the US would be forced to recognize the conservative kingdom’s importance to both its economy and its way of life. 

The problem, from America’s point of view, was that Saudi Arabia wasn’t another Indonesia. The spike in oil prices had flooded the country’s royal coffers. It could afford whatever it wanted, so the technique favored by EHMs – using debt to control a country’s leaders – wouldn’t work. 

Cracking the Saudi nut would require a new approach. 

# Washington had to figure out what the Saudis wanted before they would guarantee its oil supply. 

In 1974, a Saudi diplomat gave the author a photograph of his country’s capital, Riyadh. It showed a government building with a mound of garbage piled up in front of it. In this garbage was a flock of goats. The animals, the diplomat explained, were used as a garbage disposal system. It was left to them, he added, because no “self-respecting Saudi” would ever collect trash.

It was a “eureka” moment; the author realized this photo was a vital clue to a puzzle the US was currently trying to solve.  

**The key message here is: Washington had to figure out what the Saudis wanted before they would guarantee its oil supply. **

Negotiations between the US and Saudi Arabia began as soon as the embargo was lifted. What could the US offer? Well, the Saudis weren’t interested in loans – they had money to burn, after all. That left other forms of assistance, from military hardware to technical support and training. Whatever shape it came in, this would be a direct cash infusion. 

MAIN was hired during these negotiations to find creative justifications for pouring billions of dollars into the Saudi economy. This was the project Perkins was working on when he looked at the ambassador’s photo of Riyadh.

The oil boom meant that more and more wealthy Saudis were traveling, partying, and living in the West. These jet-setters were cosmopolitan and urbane, and they hated everything the goats stood for. They wanted their country to be as modern as they themselves were, and **that **was something the US could give them. 

Over the next year, Perkins fleshed out an ambitious plan for Saudi Arabia’s future. Petrochemical plants and industrial parks would rise out of the desert. Thousands of miles of highways, pipelines, and telephone cables would be laid. New airports would be built and existing seaports improved. Skyscrapers and shopping malls would appear in cities. In short, Saudi Arabia would be modernized, and shiny new trash compactors would replace its garbage-munching quadrupeds. 

In return for that and America’s unconditional military support, the Saudis would guarantee oil supplies and keep prices at levels that were acceptable to the US. The two parties agreed. 

America’s oil supply was safe. Even if other countries like Iran, Iraq, or Indonesia attempted an embargo, it wouldn’t work – Saudi Arabia’s oil reserves were so large it could always step in to fill the gap. 

# After the 1979 Iranian Revolution, Perkins realized he could no longer serve the American empire. 

With the Saudi deal wrapped up, Perkins was redeployed. Between 1975 and 1978, he spent most of his time overseeing infrastructural projects in another oil-rich Muslim state: Iran. 

The country appeared to be prospering. Sure, Iran’s leader – the Shah, meaning “king” in Persian – was an unelected strongman, but he seemed to be popular. And Iran was enjoying an unprecedented economic boom thanks to the government’s ambitious modernization program. 

But appearances often deceive. Iranians praised the Shah when they spoke English with foreigners like Perkins, but these conversations rarely reflected their true opinions. Deep down, many despised the Shah and the US-backed regime he imposed on Iran after the coup in 1953. 

**The key message in this blink is: After the 1979 Iranian Revolution, Perkins realized he could no longer serve the American empire. **

In late 1978, Perkins had dinner with an Iranian general who had once jumped in front of the Shah to save him from an assassin’s bullet. He expected this old loyalist to sing the Shah’s praises, but he was in for a surprise. 

The Shah, the general said, was a dead man walking – it was only a matter of time before the Iranians would topple his regime. 

Why was this? Well, the Shah was corrupt and greedy. Worse, he was brutal. SAVAK, his secret police, tortured and killed dissidents with impunity. The only reason the Shah remained in power was his alliance with the US. This arrangement served two purposes: it kept Iranian oil flowing, and it helped protect America’s top Middle Eastern ally, Israel. The people opposed these policies, however, which is why the US backed a brutal dictator like the Shah – given a chance, or a vote, Iranians would support a government that shared their views. 

But, the general concluded, you can only repress people’s true views for so long. Sooner or later, they rebel. He was right. 

The first protests began in late 1978. Soon, Iran was in the throes of a popular Islamic revolution. Fearing for his life, the Shah fled in January 1979. It was an eye-opening moment for Perkins. The US had imposed a brutal and unpopular regime on a country to protect its own interests. Now, it was facing the consequences – an explosion of anti-American rage. 

Like the Vietnamese back in 1965, Perkins couldn’t help but feel that Iranians were in the right. Why **shouldn’t** they get to decide who ruled them and to what end? It was the beginning of the end. Unable to square his convictions with his work as an EHM, he decided to quit MAIN in 1980. 

# Final summary

The key message in these blinks:

**The Cold War was a cagey affair. Both the US and the Soviet Union, the world’s only remaining empires, wanted to project their power while avoiding a catastrophic nuclear war. The US found an answer to this strategic conundrum in Iran, where it trialed a new covert strategy in the early 1950s. Later, this approach would be outsourced to the private sector, which would employ “Economic Hit Men” like the author to do Washington’s bidding. From Indonesia to Saudi Arabia, these EHMs would take the lead in fulfilling America’s foreign policy goals. **

Dodgy financial deals are at the heart of an EHM’s work. These deals have two aspects: the political and the economic. The political part of the equation requires patience and careful planning. This is tricky work, and it depends on the context in which the EHM is operating. The economic side, by contrast, is pretty simple. 

That’s because financial scams only come in a limited range of flavors. As financial expert Ken Fisher notes, fraudsters have a pretty simple playbook, and they follow it time and again. That means you can learn to spot them. How? Check out our blinks to **How to Smell a Rat**, by Ken Fisher and Lara Hoffmans to find out!
