 (2020) is a compassionate account of the chilling history of the Galvin family. Between the years 1945 and 1965, Don and Mimi raised 12 children in their suburban home in Colorado Springs, six of whom were eventually diagnosed with schizophrenia. Their story is one of heartbreaking childhood trauma, debilitating illness, and, ultimately, scientific research that could change the way our society engages with mentally ill people. 


# What’s in it for me? An unflinching look at one family’s tragic, terrifying battle with mental illness.

When two people fall in love, there’s often talk of chemistry. The sparks definitely flew when Mimi Blayney met Don Galvin at a swim meet in 1937. He asked her out immediately, and they were together from then until Don’s death in 2003.

But something else was going on between Don and Mimi besides the chemical rush of teenage hormones. If they’d found other partners, they might have produced children who were conventional, genetically unexceptional. But Don and Mimi’s genes combined in a way that wasn’t ordinary. Their unique genetic cocktail created children with a predilection toward schizophrenia. That meant that any emotional or physical trauma would push the children ever closer to debilitating mental illness.

Don and Mimi had 12 children, and all of them were exposed to abuse in some form. At least a third experienced sexual abuse, some at the hands of their own siblings. Others went through parental neglect, almost inevitable in such a large family. They all experienced violence at home. And all of them either experienced schizophrenia themselves, or had the traumatic experience of watching their close family members lose their grip on reality. Ultimately, half of the Galvin children were diagnosed with schizophrenia. The other half are still dealing with the fallout from their childhood on Hidden Valley Road: a fun house reflection of the American dream. They are, according to one researcher, the most mentally ill family in America.

In these blinks, you’ll learn

- how nature and nurture combine to trigger schizophrenia;
- why Alfred Hitchcock’s **Psycho** is the archetype of mid-century American psychiatry; and
- how the Galvins might make it possible for researchers to help future generations.

# Mimi agreed to pregnancy after pregnancy to distract from her many disappointments.

The early years of Mimi’s marriage were a far cry from her exhilarating romance with dreamy, dark-haired Don. After their 1944 shotgun wedding in Tijuana, Mimi joked that Don only came home long enough to get her pregnant again.

By the time the couple moved to Colorado Springs for Don’s new job, Mimi had given birth to three boys, and Don had already had an affair, the first of at least six throughout their marriage. Mimi was disappointed by married life. She’d left her home behind to follow Don around the country;** **now she felt abandoned. Don wanted a big family; so, in hopes of luring him back home, Mimi agreed to pregnancy after pregnancy.

The children did bring her joy. They let her play the role of “good mother,” even if Don wasn’t around.

**The key message here is: Mimi agreed to pregnancy after pregnancy to distract from her many disappointments.**

The couple got a big new house on Hidden Valley Road. But it didn’t change the distance that was developing between them. Don didn’t tell Mimi much about his life. But Mimi kept trying to make him happy. She even converted to Catholicism for him, something she’d promised before they got married. She became close with the local priest in Colorado Springs. They would study scripture together over cocktails, and he got acquainted with her growing number of sons, too. By 1957, Mimi and Don had eight boys. They all slept in one room, in two four-bed bunks in the basement.

The eldest, Donald Jr., grew into a high school football star. He was dashingly handsome, all dark hair and flashing eyes, just like his father. But he wasn’t clever or charismatic like Don Sr. Worse, he was violent. He would force the younger brothers to fight each other. He and Jim, the second oldest, fought terrible battles all through the house.

Don and Mimi chalked it up to boys being boys. But it was more than that. Even Donald Jr. himself knew he wasn’t connecting with the world in a conventional way. This was the first sign of his eventual diagnosis: schizophrenia.

There was another reason for Donald Jr.’s angst, one that didn’t become clear until decades later.

Their priest, Father Freudenstein, had been abusing him for years, along with dozens of other boys in Colorado Springs. Eventually, doctors would blame this abuse for Donald’s psychotic break, the initial spring of a waterfall of family trauma.

# As Don and Mimi moved up socially, their sons’ mental health began deteriorating.

Jim, the second oldest, couldn’t match Donald Jr. in looks or athletic ability, so he adopted a James Dean persona, complete with leather jacket and sneer. There was no love lost between the two oldest Galvin boys, and the only way they dealt with it was through violence. The younger boys got caught up in it. Every day brought new battles in the backyard and on the way to and from school.

Don had taken to referring to his boys as numbers, instead of names. “Number Four, come here,” he’d say, speaking to his son Brian. The boys often felt lost in the shuffle, and they rarely felt safe.

**The key message here is: As Don and Mimi moved up socially, their sons’ mental health began deteriorating.**

Don and Mimi chose to see what was happening as just roughhousing. They had an exciting social calendar, thanks to Don’s new job as executive director of a lobbying group focused on promoting the arts. They hobnobbed at parties in Aspen and Santa Fe, rubbing shoulders with the likes of Andrew Wyeth and Georgia O’Keeffe. Mimi was happy for the first time in years. Acknowledging anything was wrong at home would have imperiled the couple’s flourishing reputation in Coloradan society.

But something was wrong in their family, and it was only getting more obvious. Once Donald Jr. went off to college, his connection with reality became looser and looser. He admitted to a school counselor he was killing cats and dogs, and he fantasized about killing people, too. When Don and Mimi picked him up from school, he was washing his hair with beer. But instead of getting help, they got a doctor’s note from a family friend, giving Donald Jr. the psychiatric all-clear. The college took him back.

Jim went to college too, for a year or so. When his girlfriend Kathy got pregnant, they married, and he dropped out and became a bartender. Their marriage was a shambles from the get go: not only did Jim cheat on her, he abused her. Kathy wanted to leave, but she felt sorry for him. He had begun to be tormented by voices. He was briefly hospitalized for a psychotic episode, for the first time, on Halloween 1969.

When Kathy told Don and Mimi what had happened, she expected tears. Instead, she got stony faces. Jim’s parents acted as if their son’s hospitalization was nothing unusual. They didn’t tell Kathy that Jim’s older brother Donald Jr. had also been behaving strangely.

# At the time, seeking professional help for mental illness was a nightmarish prospect.

To our modern sensibilities, Don and Mimi might seem like incredibly callous parents. How could they have accepted any of their children feeling unsafe? Or prioritize their social reputation over their children’s health?

Mimi admits she wasn’t the perfect mother. But she and Don were optimists, as is anyone who has 12 children. At first, she hoped the situation would get better once the boys were living on their own. Then she realized her two oldest boys needed help. But there wasn’t much help to be had.

**The key message here is: At the time, seeking professional help for mental illness was a nightmarish prospect.**

Ever since England’s King Henry VI inherited his grandfather’s insanity and kicked off the fifteenth-century Wars of the Roses, people have known that mental illness can run in families. But Freud questioned this conventional wisdom: what if people weren’t born with schizophrenia, but acquired it in life?

The psychotherapist Frieda Fromm-Reichmann took Freud’s theory a step further. In 1940, she began publicizing her theory that neglectful mothers were responsible for mental illness. In a time when the role of mother was changing, the idea caught fire. In the 1950s and ’60s, almost every emotional or mental problem was attributed to a patient’s mother. Even Hollywood caught on: in Alfred Hitchcock’s 1960 classic **Psycho**, the blame for Norman Bates’s homicidal delusions is placed squarely on the shoulders of his mother.

What’s more, the therapies at the time for mental illness were often scarier than the symptoms themselves. Schizophrenia patients were warehoused at institutions, sometimes for decades at a time, and forced to take things like cocaine and castor oil. They were gassed with carbon dioxide, lobotomized, shocked with insulin, and injected with turpentine and animal blood. Sometimes, they were sterilized without their consent.

So when the Galvin boys started getting sick, Mimi was stuck in an impossible position. The psychiatry profession was bound to blame her for everything. Even if she was able to withstand the sexist scrutiny, her beloved sons would be subjected to a cure that was arguably worse than the disease.

The lesson of the time seemed clear: if your children experienced mental illness, the last thing you wanted to do was talk to a psychiatrist about it.

# Donald Jr.’s first hospitalization exacerbated the terrifying mayhem on Hidden Valley Road.

With Donald Jr. back at college, things seemed OK for a while. He was back in classes, and he even started dating a woman named Jean. After the two began living together, the relationship quickly deteriorated. During one fight, Donald Jr. threatened to drown Jean. She told him, unequivocally, that she was leaving. This triggered Donald’s first major psychotic decompensation.

A few days later, he came home with two cyanide tablets and tried to force Jean to take one. The other was intended for himself. Jean escaped, and Donald Jr. was arrested. Mimi and Don no longer had a choice: their son was sent to Pueblo, the state in-patient mental hospital.

**The key message here is: Donald Jr.’s first hospitalization exacerbated the terrifying mayhem on Hidden Valley Road.**

The standard of care at Pueblo was appalling. Staff members didn’t even have nursing degrees, and there were only a handful of doctors caring for over 2,000 patients. The facility was allowed to prescribe Thorazine, an untested drug developed as a battlefield anesthetic after World War II. Once Donald Jr. was put on a regimen of drugs, he was deemed ready for release. He came home after just a few weeks.

Donald Jr.’s homecoming plunged the Galvin family further into the abyss. Don and Mimi’s youngest children, Margaret and Mary, were eight and seven, respectively. They would frequently come home from school to find Donald Jr. stark naked and raving. The violence continued, too: Donald Jr. regularly menaced his mother with a knife. The younger brothers would have to wrestle him to the floor.

Every day brought fear for the girls. They were handled roughly by their older brothers, tossed around like dolls. As they got older, the treatment went from roughhousing to arguably physical abuse.

Incredibly, Mimi still managed to outwardly ignore what was happening. Instead, she doubled down on her perfectionism. The girls were expected to set the table and wash up after dinner as though there weren’t a 25-year-old man writhing on the floor.

Donald Jr.’s younger brothers cruelly made fun of him. Jim was especially vicious, mocking his brother for living at home at his age. But Jim also relished the opportunity to protect his younger siblings from Donald Jr. He and Kathy invited the girls to come by their house anytime, sometimes for entire weekends. Mimi was grateful for the respite.

Jim was kind and welcoming to his young sisters. But then, he started to touch them.

# As the Galvin children grew up, they each sought ways to deal with the looming specter of mental illness.

Jim sexually abused his sisters for years, starting when Margaret was five years old. But their idea of normal was so skewed that they didn’t see the abuse as violence. They saw it as affection.

They were the first to see that Jim was as unstable as Donald Jr. In addition to the sexual abuse, they saw that he drank, that he was violent to his wife.

Still, they tolerated Jim’s abuse, partly because it seemed like a reasonable trade for a few days’ break from Hidden Valley Road.

And there was another reason the sexual abuse seemed normal. Jim wasn’t the first brother to abuse them. One of Mary’s earliest memories is of Brian molesting her, when she was three years old.

**The key message here is: As the Galvin children grew up, they each sought ways to deal with the looming specter of mental illness.**

The girls’ traumatic early memories of Brian didn’t match what the outside world saw. Brian was the wonder boy of the family, the most handsome and clever, a natural athlete and musician, and most beloved by Don and Mimi. Their idolization of Brian continued even after he dropped out of college, started dropping acid, and moved to California to start a band.

Michael, the fifth oldest, never bothered with college. He hitchhiked around the country taking mushrooms. After a series of arrests, he was sentenced to five months in a maximum-security mental hospital. But he wasn’t ill like his brothers. He was just a hippie with an authority problem. He would spend the rest of his life trying to prove it.

Son number six, Richard, was a hockey star. At age 17, after scoring the winning goal at the state championship, he got a girl pregnant. They decided to get married. Richard was high on mushrooms for the wedding. Donald Jr. interrupted the ceremony by shouting that the marriage was not in God’s truth.

The third oldest, John, spent most of his childhood practicing piano and avoiding his older brothers. He got a scholarship to study music at university and rarely came home to Hidden Valley Road.

The one time he did, things seemed worse than ever: Donald Jr. swung wildly between raving and violence. Mimi had an inventory of stock speeches, designed to counter-program Donald Jr.’s common rants. She bragged about her society parties, acting like nothing was wrong.

Things were bad. But they were about to get even worse.

# Brian’s murder-suicide was a new low for the Galvins, but they hadn’t reached rock bottom yet.

Mimi had become extremely skilled at brushing bad news under the carpet. She was used to getting calls from the police station and the mental hospital, and news about expulsions or teen pregnancies.

But nothing could have prepared her for the call that came one morning in late summer, 1973. The girlfriend of her wonder son, Brian, hadn’t shown up at work. When the cops went to check on her, they found her dead.

She wasn’t alone. Brian had shot her in the face, and then he’d turned the gun on himself.

Mimi told the girls Brian had died in a bicycle accident. She told friends he had been killed in a botched robbery. Only she and Don knew the secret they would keep for many years: Brian had been diagnosed with psychosis a few years earlier.

**They key message here is: Brian’s murder-suicide was a new low for the Galvins, but they hadn’t reached rock bottom yet.**

For years, Don did everything he could to distance himself from his out-of-control family. He took night classes, manned the cocktail shaker at parties, and carried on with other women.

But what Brian did was too much for him to bear, and he internalized the pain. In 1975, he had a massive stroke right in front of his youngest son, Peter. Don was hospitalized for six months, and would never fully recover. He was dependent on Mimi for the rest of his life.

Peter wouldn’t be the same either. He suffered his first psychotic break shortly after witnessing his father’s collapse. He was only fifteen.

The Galvins were becoming well-known among the staff at Pueblo, the state mental institution. Seemingly out of the blue, Matt, the second-youngest boy, had decided he was Paul McCartney. Matt, Peter, and Donald Jr. were now cycling in and out of Pueblo. During family visits, staff could already sense there was something off about Joe, the seventh son.

In a rare show of weakness, Mimi broke down on the phone to a society friend. “You’ve got to get those girls out of there,” the woman said. “Send me Margaret.” Mimi did as she was told.

So Mary, now 13, was the only child left at home who wasn’t experiencing psychosis. To escape, she applied and was accepted to a boarding school on the East Coast.

Knowing he would soon lose access to Mary, Jim escalated his abuse. The summer before his sister left for her new school, he raped her.

# With all the children out of the house, most of the damage had been done. But healing was still a long way off.

The Galvins’ introspective seventh son, Joe, was the last to suffer a psychotic decompensation. His was triggered when he was refused a promotion at work. Now, four Galvin brothers were on more or less the same cycle. They lived between Pueblo, the street, and the house on Hidden Valley Road. Sometimes, they landed in jail.

Jim wasn’t in and out of Pueblo as much. But he was now the brother everyone was worried about most. Kathy had finally left him, after he hit their son Jimmy. Jim was now living alone, working less and drinking more. When Mary brought a boyfriend home from college, Jim slashed his tires and screamed obscenities.

The healthy Gavin children were haunted by their trauma, and they feared they might be next in line to lose their minds. So they stayed as far away from Hidden Valley Road as they could.

**The key message here is: With all the children out of the house, most of the damage had been done. But healing was still a long way off.**

Each of the siblings was searching for their own narrative. Mary changed her name to Lindsay, to have something that was her own and not her family’s. Margaret dropped out of college to follow the Grateful Dead around the country; she stayed high on cocaine and mushrooms and had a one-year marriage to a drug dealer. The four healthy boys didn’t call much, and visited less. Don’s health continued to deteriorate as he sat at home all day, wondering what had happened to his life.

Meanwhile, Donald Jr. was trendsetting for the family once again. Now in his forties, he had aged out of most of his violence. The decades of schizophrenia medication had taken a toll on him, as it would on all the other unwell brothers. He was obese, with a weak heart and tremors. But for all the damage it had done, the medication hadn’t helped much. Donald Jr. now believed he was the son of an octopus.

But Lindsay was making progress on her journey to reckon with her abuse and regain her agency. In college, she started seeing a therapist to deal with her debilitating anxiety. Her first therapist flat out didn’t believe that she had six older siblings with schizophrenia. But when she finally got a good counselor, she was able to begin unpacking her decades of trauma. It was a process that would last 25 years.

# The huge Galvin family is an ideal genetic sample set for schizophrenia researchers to help future generations.

In the decades since Donald Jr.’s first hospitalization, the field of psychiatry had been racked with internal conflict. Unable to find concrete proof of what caused schizophrenia, the field was riven into two camps: nature vs. nurture. Theories abounded, but science was no closer to finding a treatment that worked, much less a cure.

But that didn’t mean researchers weren’t working. Dr. Lynn DeLisi, a psychiatric geneticist, believed the roots of the disease were physical. She devoted her career to finding a genetic marker of the disease.

Dr. Robert Freedman, on the other hand, was more interested in how the disease worked. What was happening in the brain to cause such debilitating behavioral symptoms?

But there was one issue tormenting both scientists: why had this one family been hit so hard with the illness?

**The key message here is: The huge Galvin family is an ideal genetic sample set for schizophrenia researchers to help future generations.**

Lynn DeLisi first contacted the Galvins in 1990. Mimi was over the moon: she’d been waiting decades for a doctor like this to show up, someone who could relieve her nagging feeling that all this might be her fault. DeLisi collected genetic samples from everyone in the family. Her plan was to compare and contrast the Galvin DNA to isolate which gene was the source of schizophrenia.

When DeLisi told Freedman about the extraordinary Galvin family, he was as intrigued as well. Freedman invited the Galvins to his lab. He wanted to test them to locate the specific part of the brain responsible for schizophrenia symptoms.

Both hoped that their research would lead to a drug that could help treat schizophrenia, or even a way to predict who’s at risk. After a series of frustrating dead ends, both doctors found genes that they believe are associated with schizophrenia.

The story is more complicated than just one gene, though. Scientists now largely agree that while schizophrenia patients share the same gene mutations,** **it takes environmental factors – most often childhood trauma – to push someone over the schizophrenia threshold.

The Galvins made these discoveries possible. But even today, a drug that helps relieve psychosis enough to justify the side effects is a long way off. DeLisi’s and Freedman’s breakthroughs were too late to help the Galvins. Jim and Joe died of complications from weakened hearts, caused by decades of schizophrenia drugs. The drugs had made only marginal improvements to their lives. Donald Jr., Matt, and Peter are still taking them. They have no other choice.

# Through therapy, Lindsay was able to reckon with her family’s past – and lead the way forward.

As Mimi grew older, Lindsay took on more responsibility for her family’s care. Her years of therapy had allowed her to reckon with her trauma enough to engage with the extraordinary reality of her family.

Lindsay also told Mimi that Jim had sexually abused her for years. Mimi, without missing a beat, revealed that, as a girl, she’d been abused by her stepfather. Lindsay was floored by Mimi’s candor. But Mimi couldn’t bring herself to acknowledge that what Jim had done was wrong. Lindsay was crushed, but determined: she told Mimi that she would never again be in the same room as Jim. She kept her promise for the rest of Jim’s life.

**The key message here is: Through therapy, Lindsay was able to reckon with her family’s past – and lead the way forward.**

Lindsay even became the legal guardian for her brother Peter. She thought she could do a better job managing his care. He came to live with her, and he seemed to be improving. During this time, she learned that as a child Peter had also been abused by Jim.

But when Peter stopped taking his medication, his violent psychosis came back worse than ever. It got to be too much for Lindsay, who now had a husband and two children of her own. The best place for Peter, Dr. Freedman told her, was back at Pueblo.

When Mimi died at age 90, Lindsay handled her end-of-life care, and sold the house on Hidden Valley Road. She went through medical records and discovered, for the first time, that Donald had tried to kill his girlfriend Jean, all those years ago. She was haunted by her parents’ secrecy. What if they’d been more open? Could Brian’s murder-suicide have been prevented?

In going through her family’s medical records, Lindsay was looking for more than just closure. She wanted to predict what was in store for her own children – Jack and Kate. From a young age, Lindsay was on the lookout for any signs of illness among the kids.

Both are thriving.** **Lindsay’s daughter Kate now works at Dr. Freedman’s university lab, home to her grandfather’s brain and DNA samples from dozens of her extended family members. She was the first undergraduate to earn a place in the lab, so her first day caused quite a stir. Another student joked that her family must be huge donors. Kate was ready with a retort: “do you mean money, or tissue?”

# Final summary

The key message in these blinks:

**The story of the Galvin family is a personal, heartbreaking window into how little we know about schizophrenia. But through DNA sampling and brain testing, the Galvins’ tragic history may yet shed light on how to treat, predict, and even prevent this debilitating disease for future generations.**

**What to read next: ******No One Cares About Crazy People******, by Ron Powers**

You’ve just learned how ill-equipped the American mental health care system was to help the six Galvin brothers diagnosed with schizophrenia, much less their parents, siblings, children, and spouses who suffered – sometimes fatally – from being in their proximity. Sadly, the treatment for schizophrenia has changed little in the nearly six decades since the first Galvin boy was diagnosed. The same drugs are still in use, which offer only marginal improvements to a patient’s quality of life while having extremely deleterious health consequences.

**No One Cares About Crazy People** by Ron Powers offers a deeper look into the ineffective and inefficient American mental health care system. Powers knows first-hand the challenges faced by the mentally ill and their families: both his sons were diagnosed with schizophrenia, and he lost one to suicide. The blinks to **No One Cares About Crazy People** examine the myths we’ve created about mentally ill people, and the short-sighted, disjointed public policy that has resulted.
