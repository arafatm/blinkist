(2018) explores what disorders and diseases of the brain can tell us about the inner workings of our minds. Acclaimed neuroscientist Eric R. Kandel draws on a lifetime of research to explain what depression, schizophrenia, addiction, and more reveal about how our brains affect our thoughts, feelings, and behavior – and explains how new scientific methods could help solve the big puzzle of consciousness.


# What’s in it for me? Learn how your brain works from brains that work differently.

Brains are like really fancy computers. They consist of billions of tiny, interconnected parts that work together in programmed patterns to produce our thoughts, feelings, and behavior. And as with computers, sometimes we can learn most about how things work when they **don’t**.

Since French doctor Philippe Pinel founded psychiatry in 1790, the study of brain disorders, injuries, and illnesses has produced amazing insights into the inner workings of our minds and brains. That’s because such disruptions allow us to observe how concrete biological changes in our brains affect our thoughts, feelings, and behavior.

In recent years, technological advances have allowed us to study **disordered minds **in more depth than ever before. These blinks present some of the most important insights that modern neuroscience has gleaned from such research. Connecting biology, psychology, and neuroscience, we’ll explore what we can learn from autism about the brain’s social nature, from schizophrenia about creativity, from Alzheimer’s about memory, and more.

In these blinks, you’ll discover

- which brain chemical links schizophrenia and Parkinson’s disease;
- why addiction is a chronic illness; and
- how our unconscious minds rule our lives.

# Brains that work abnormally can teach us how brains normally work.

We all get terribly sad sometimes. Everyone occasionally has wild ideas, strange urges, and moments of anxiety, euphoria, or forgetfulness. But what if we’re sad, euphoric, or forgetful all the time?

When ordinary mental experiences go into overdrive and begin to interfere with our daily lives, they might indicate a mental disorder. Mental disorders such as depression, schizophrenia, or dementia are often characterized by exaggerations of everyday thoughts, feelings, and behavior. When you’re clinically depressed, for example, you don’t feel down occasionally – you feel debilitatingly sad over weeks and months.

**The key message here is: Brains that work abnormally can teach us how brains normally work.**

Psychiatry, the medical study of mental disorders, was founded by French physician Philippe Pinel in 1790. Pinel was the first scientist to suggest that mental disorders have a physical basis.

Today, we know that all mental disorders are also disorders of the brain. Genetic defects, environmental factors, or injury can change the brain’s normal structure and functioning. Because there’s a direct link between these physical changes and their effect on a person’s thoughts, feelings, and behavior, mental disorders reveal a lot about how our brains work.

Before we dive into this field of study, let’s go over some basics. The brain is made up of millions of specialized nerve cells called **neurons** that form intricate networks to pass information between our brain, body, and senses, which give rise to our mental processes. Neurons communicate with each other through a system of electrical signals, and chemical molecules called **neurotransmitters**. In many mental disorders, certain networks of neurons become dysfunctional, hyperactive, or unable to communicate.

Modern neuroscience** **studies why and how this happens, using the latest scientific technologies. For example, scientists can now alter, delete, or insert certain genes in mice to learn how these genes affect the brain. Thanks to such animal models, we now know that there’s simple genetic disorders of the brain like Huntington’s that are caused by a single mutated gene, and complex genetic disorders like depression that involve multiple genes and environmental factors.

In addition, modern brain imaging techniques allow neuroscientists to study the activity of the brain in action. An fMRI, for instance, measures changes in the concentration of oxygen in red blood cells to determine which parts of the brain are active at any given moment. Equipped with these technologies, the study of brain disorders is shining a light into the healthy brain.

# Autism reveals the deeply social nature of our brains.

Did you know that most of us can read minds? Well, at least our brains pretend we can.

Because humans are social creatures, our brains learn to attribute thoughts and emotions to others nearly automatically. Around the age of three, most children begin to understand that the people around them have a mind of their own. This **theory of mind**, as psychologists call it, helps them understand and predict other people’s behavior, and allows them to navigate the social world quickly and efficiently. For children with autism, however, these things are neither easy nor automatic.

**The key message here is: Autism reveals the deeply social nature of our brains.**

Autism is a developmental disorder that begins in early childhood, and primarily affects a person’s social and communication skills. Autism has a wide spectrum, meaning that there are many shades of severity, but most autistic children have great difficulties with reading other people’s thoughts and emotions, responding appropriately to others, and picking up language early in life.

In addition, autistic children have a strong preference for being alone rather than playing with others. They’re also often very sensitive to change, preferring things to stay the same – which is why many of them enjoy repetitive play with the same toys, over and over again. This leads to another characteristic: many autistic people have savant-like skills in a highly specific field such as drawing or arithmetic.

Many of these symptoms can be traced to the fact that in autism, parts of the brain don’t develop properly, while other parts develop prematurely to compensate for the defect. In 1990, Leslie Brothers of UCLA School of Medicine found that the brain regions disrupted in autistic children primarily involve emotion, language, and communication, but also regions involved in visual perception and movement. Brothers proposed that in ordinary brains, these regions form a kind of **social brain** that helps us process information about other humans in a specialized manner.

Because of an underdevelopment of the social brain, autistic children have difficulties developing a theory of mind, communicating with others, and recognizing human faces and movement. Brain imaging reveals that for autistic children, watching a person walk is not much different from watching the arms of a clock move. In normally developing children however, watching any human or human-like movement automatically activates the social brain.

In this way, autism has given us an amazing opportunity to investigate the special social wiring of our brains.

# Mood disorders are linked to chemical imbalances involving the brain’s emotional system.

Emotions are a big part of how we experience the world. They help us connect with others, recognize our desires, and make judgement calls when reason alone won’t suffice. When the emotional system in our brains goes haywire, it can cause a great deal of suffering.

In mental disorders like PTSD or depression, the brain gets stuck in a loop of extremely negative emotions, causing a permanently low mood or extreme mental anguish. Unfortunately, such disorders affect nearly one-third of Americans at least once in their lives – making understanding and treating them all the more important.

**Here’s the key message: Mood disorders are linked to chemical imbalances involving the brain’s emotional system.**

All of our moods and emotions evolve from a few basic emotional responses. These **primal emotions **are deeply ingrained in our brains, because they helped our ancestors survive. When you see a bear, for example, it makes sense to feel afraid instantly, rather than spend time and energy to critically assess the danger of the situation.

Emotional responses like fear can be inborn, but they can also be learned through experience. If a mouse learns to associate a particular sound with an electric shock, for example, it will soon learn to fear the sound itself. Once such a connection has been made in the deep-seated emotional pathways of our brains, it becomes very hard to unlearn – which is why mood and anxiety disorders can be so hard to treat.

Emotional responses are chiefly regulated by a set of brain structures called the **limbic system**. The limbic system includes the **hypothalamus**, which controls bodily responses such as a pounding heart or sweaty palms, and the **amygdala**, a little structure deep in our brains that orchestrates our initial emotional response.

In people with depression, PTSD, and other anxiety disorders, the amygdala and hypothalamus are constantly overactive, and many chemicals the limbic system uses to communicate are out of balance. Scientists have found that all of these disorders, for example, are linked to chronically elevated levels of **cortisol**, the body’s stress hormone. In excess, cortisol causes changes in sleep, energy, and appetite.

Studying how antidepressants work has also revealed that people with depression and anxiety seem to have lower levels of the neurotransmitter **serotonin **in their brain. Serotonin is one of the chemical messenger molecules neurons use to communicate, and is involved in a wide range of mental processes from emotion to cognition, learning, and memory.

# Schizophrenia affects a variety of brain structures linked to thought, memory, and creativity.

Of all the mental disorders, schizophrenia might still be the most stigmatized. That’s because it affects a wide range of brain regions, and thus causes dramatic effects on thinking and behavior.

For one, people with schizophrenia often experience visual and auditory hallucinations and paranoid delusions. They may believe that someone is sending them special messages, or that other people are out to get them. But schizophrenia also comes with less obvious symptoms such as social withdrawal, lack of motivation, and memory problems.

**The key message here is: Schizophrenia affects a variety of brain structures linked to thought, memory, and creativity.**

The drastic structural changes that schizophrenia causes in the brain are linked to an excess of **synaptic pruning **during adolescence. Synapses are the connection points between individual neurons. A three-year-old’s brain contains twice as many of them** **as an adult’s brain. Around puberty, the brain begins to cut some of these connections, making mental processes more streamlined and efficient. In schizophrenia, however this pruning process goes haywire. As a result, regions of the brain such as the** **prefrontal **cortex**, which is involved in planning and decision-making, and the** **hippocampus, which is involved in memory, don’t develop properly.

The excessive pruning seems to have a genetic basis. Studies have found that people with schizophrenia are more likely to have a particular variant of a gene called C4, the role of which is to tag the synapses for pruning. The overexpression of this gene results in the cutting of more connections than necessary.

The neurotransmitter **dopamine **also plays another crucial role in schizophrenia. Like serotonin, dopamine is a complex chemical messenger involved in such important functions as thought, memory, emotion, movement, and behavior. Schizophrenia seems to involve an excess of dopamine in the brain.

Another puzzling feature of schizophrenia is that many people affected by it produce amazingly original artworks. In the early nineteenth century, Italian physician Cesare Lombroso published the first collection of schizophrenic art in a book called** Genius and Madness, **which later became the founding bible of the Dada and Surrealist movement.

Throughout history, mental disorders have often been linked to creativity. Indeed, recent studies show that creative people are more likely to suffer from mental disorders. Writer Jack Kerouac, for example, was known to be schizophrenic, and Vincent Van Gogh was likely bipolar. Science still has no good explanation for this connection, but one theory is that mental disorders fuel creativity by lifting constraints and inhibitions on our thinking and giving us a broader access to our unconscious.

# In Alzheimer’s and dementia, faulty proteins erode our brain’s explicit memory system.

Henry Molaison, known to his doctors only as H.M., is one of the most important patients in the history of neuroscience. Like many of them, he wasn’t a particularly lucky guy. After injuring his head in a bike accident as a child, H.M. began suffering from severe epilepsy as an adult. To stop the seizures, his doctors decided to take out the parts of the brain that had been scarred in the accident.

The operation swiftly cured H.M.’s epilepsy, but it came at a high price: H.M. still remembered people and events from many years ago, but he could no longer form new memories. Every new piece of information he learned after the operation he immediately forgot. Surprisingly, researchers found that he could still learn new motor tasks like learning new drawing skills – he just didn’t remember practicing.

**The key message here is: In Alzheimer’s and dementia, faulty proteins erode our brain’s explicit memory system.**

The case of H.M. revealed that the brain has two separate memory systems: an **explicit **memory system that’s responsible for remembering events and people, and an **implicit **memory system that helps us remember learned motor tasks automatically, like riding a bike or playing the piano. Explicit memory crucially involves the hippocampus – the part of the brain that doctors removed in H.M.

The two most common brain disorders affecting memory, Alzheimer’s disease and dementia, also affect the hippocampus, and can gradually erode memory. In these disorders however, the damage isn’t done by adventurous doctors, but by faulty proteins in the brain.

Here’s where it gets a bit complicated, but bear with us and you’ll learn what these proteins are doing wrong. In a healthy state, proteins fold in a characteristic, three-dimensional shape. The specific shape of a protein fits into specific receptors in the brain like a key in a lock, and therefore is crucial to its function. In Alzheimer’s and dementia, proteins don’t fold properly, and begin to clump together. Scientists call these abnormally folded proteins **prions.**

Misfolded proteins usually occur in the prefrontal cortex first, but later make their way to the hippocampus, the seat of explicit memory. They first result in a loss of connection between neurons, and in later stages of the disease kill them off completely.

Memory disorders have taught us a lot about how tiny changes in the brain can have wide ranging consequences in the brain – but the discovery of prions has also opened up new possibilities for the treatment of these diseases.

# Parkinson’s disease reveals the role of brain chemicals in movement.

Dementia and Alzheimer’s aren’t the only neurological disorders caused by misfolding proteins. Since there are countless different proteins in the human brain, there are countless ways in which faulty proteins can affect our thoughts and behavior. In Parkinson’s and Huntington’s disease, for instance, misfolding proteins in the brain slowly erode a person’s ability to move.

**Here’s the key message: Parkinson’s disease reveals the role of brain chemicals in movement.**

When we’re healthy, movement can feel so intuitive that it’s easy to forget that our bodies are controlled by our brains. The **motor system** consists of a specialized network of neurons that begin in the brain, extend down the spine, and from there connect to each of the 650 muscles in the body. Some of these neurons send signals from the brain to muscles to initiate movement, while others send signals from muscles to the brain to give feedback about this movement.

Parkinson’s disease disrupts the normal functioning of this signal loop. This results in a characteristic tremor and a limited range of movement, typically starting around sixty years old. Parkinson’s was first described in 1817 by a British doctor of the same name, but because of its physical symptoms it wasn’t treated as a brain disorder until much later.

At the beginning of the 1900s, scientists discovered that a region in the midbrain called **substantia nigra** for its characteristic black pigmentation, had a much lighter color in the brains of people with Parkinson’s than in healthy brains. The substantia nigra is home to the neurons that produce the neurotransmitter dopamine. Remember how schizophrenia is linked to an excess of dopamine? Well, Parkinson’s is linked to a lack of dopamine.

In Parkinson’s, the dopamine-producing neurons in the substantia nigra are obstructed by misfolding **alpha-synuclein** proteins. Studying fruit flies, scientists have found that the protein misfolds because of a spontaneous mutation on the SNCA gene, the causes of which are still unclear.

At first, the neurons in the substantia nigra become hyperactive trying to compensate for the decrease in function, but eventually they are killed off by the protein clumps, and can no longer produce dopamine. Among its many functions, dopamine is crucial for muscle control. The lack of dopamine in Parkinson’s is what causes the characteristic tremor of the disease, as well as a gradual loss of speed and range of movement. The gradual death of the neurons in the substantia nigra is also the reason why this region has a lighter color in Parkinson’s patients.

# Addiction hijacks the brain’s reward system – often permanently.

Not too long ago, even psychologists believed that addiction was simply a matter of willpower. When a pleasurable behavior becomes so destructive it ruins your health and relationships, why not just stop it? Thanks to the insights of neuroscience, we know now that things are not that simple.

Like other mental disorders, addiction – whether to drugs, alcohol, gambling or eating – fundamentally changes our brains. It primarily acts on the systems involved in pleasure, emotions, and behavior, virtually robbing us of our will. This comes at a massive cost: the power of addictions costs the US economy an estimated 740 billion dollars a year.

**The key message here is: Addiction hijacks the brain’s reward system – often permanently.**

The pleasure we get from food, sex, or drugs is regulated by the brain’s **dopamine reward system**. This system includes the dopamine-producing neurons in the substantia nigra, which extend deep into the hippocampus, amygdala, and **striatum**. Remember that the hippocampus is involved with memory, while the amygdala regulates basic emotions. Now add to this the **striatum,** a brain region crucially involved in forming habits.

Generally, the brain’s reward system teaches you to seek out pleasure-inducing experiences, meaning experiences in which the feel-good chemical dopamine is released. When you eat a tasty banana, for example, your brain releases a moderate amount of dopamine. Your brain saves this experience, and the next time you see a banana you’ll be more motivated to eat it. The more dopamine is released during an experience, the more determined your reward system becomes to make you seek out that experience.

As you can imagine, most habit-forming drugs and experiences induce a bigger dopamine response than eating a banana. Cocaine, for example, causes a release of dopamine but also directly interferes with the removal of dopamine from the synapse, causing it to linger longer in the brain.

The reward system doesn’t just learn to associate the drug with pleasurable dopamine-release, but also the places, people, and music that go with it. This means that for addicts, just meeting a person associated with the drug on the street can send their brain into compulsive pleasure-seeking mode. As far as scientists know today, the pleasure associations exist in the brain permanently. That’s why the relapse rate of recovered addicts is so high, and addiction is now treated as a chronic disease.

# The development of our bodies and brains allows for many variations in sex and gender identity.

In most species, male and female animals show clear differences in behavior. Humans are no exception, though we show much greater range and variety in gendered behavior than other species.

Nonetheless, neuroscientists have discovered subtle structural and molecular differences in the brains of men and women. Gender-specific activity patterns occur in areas related to sexual and reproductive behaviors, for example, but also in regions involved in emotion, memory, and stress. We don’t know yet how these patterns translate into thought and behavior, but it appears that sex and gender also express themselves in the brain.

**The key message? The development of our bodies and brains allows for many variations in sex and gender identity.**

First things first: the sex we’re assigned at birth on the basis of our external genitalia – whether male, female, or intersex – and our **gender identity **are not the same thing. A person may have female genitalia but identify as a man. To complicate things even further, technically, there are three **distinct **types of sex.

Our **anatomical sex **is determined by our external genitalia – usually a penis or a vulva. Our **gonadal sex **is determined by our internal genitalia, the ovaries and testes that produce different sex hormones. Lastly, our **chromosomal sex **refers to the sex chromosomes we inherit from our parents. Two XX-chromosomes typically result in a female anatomy, while an X and a smaller Y-chromosome typically result in a male anatomy.

This anatomical development begins in utero around week six or seven. If the fetus has a Y chromosome, a gene called SRY initiates the formation of the testis. The testis then begin to release a bunch of testosterone – as much as during puberty – that furthers male development. If there’s no Y chromosome however, the fetus develops a female anatomy.

Shortly after birth, the body releases another bout of sex hormones – either testosterone or estrogen – that seems to influence the development of certain gender-specific brain patterns for behavior such as aggression and mating.

For most people, anatomical, gonadal, and chromosomal correspond to each other, as well as to their gender identity. But since these characteristics all develop at different times, there’s plenty of opportunity for disruptions and variations.

Certain gene mutations for instance cause anatomical sex to be dissociated from gonadal and chromosomal sex. Anatomical “women” with a gene for congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) are exposed to an excess of testosterone in the womb that is typically reserved for anatomical boys. As a result, a small but statistically significant portion of these women are bi- and homosexual, and another significant portion identifies as trans men.

# Neuroscience is beginning to unravel the mystery of consciousness.

Of all the complex mental states the brain produces, consciousness is one of its most puzzling features.

In simple terms, being conscious means being aware of our mental processes as they happen. When we’re awake, experiences such as seeing a friendly face, smelling a rose, or being afraid have a subjective quality that we can think and talk about later.

**Here’s the key message: Neuroscience is beginning to unravel the mystery of consciousness.**

Our overall level of consciousness is linked to the brain’s overall level of awareness. For example, our brains are more active when we’re awake than when we’re asleep, and least active when we’re in a coma. This level of consciousness seems to be modulated by a region in the upper brain stem. When this region is damaged in mice, for example, they fall into a coma. When it’s stimulated electrically, however, it instantly wakes them from sleep.

Neuroscientists are also trying to find out at which point certain mental experiences become conscious, and which particular parts of the brain are involved in these experiences.** **What they’ve discovered so far through brain imaging seems to support what famous psychoanalyst Sigmund Freud suggested back in the nineteenth century. First of all, our minds are clearly divided into conscious and unconscious processes. Secondly, these unconscious processes have a greater influence on our thoughts, motivations, and behavior than we care to admit.

To explain why some mental experiences become conscious and others don’t, cognitive psychologist Bernard Baars introduced the theory of the** global workspace. **This theory argues that the deeper layers of the brain are constantly processing sensory information from our surroundings unconsciously. When we direct our attention at a piece of information, our brains pick up the initial sensory signal and broadcast it to higher brain regions – making it available in the conscious global workspace.

When an image is flashed to us subliminally, meaning so quickly that we cannot consciously identify or remember what we’ve seen, the visual cortex in the back of the brain becomes very active for 200 to 300 milliseconds. After that, the signal dies down. When the image is flashed long enough, the visual signal doesn’t die down, but is propagated and amplified throughout the entire brain. Only then does the image become conscious in the global workspace.

Neuroscience still has a lot to explore when it comes to the way our brains produce consciousness. But aided by new technologies and merged with psychology, psychiatry, and biology, it might just be able to solve the greatest mystery of the brain.

# Final summary

The key message in these blinks:

**All mental disorders are linked to changes in our brains, and therefore can teach us a lot about how our brains affect our thoughts, feelings, and behavior. Most mental disorders have both genetic and environmental causes. Some disorders like autism and schizophrenia involve anatomical changes in the brain, while others like depression and Parkinson’s initially affect the chemicals our brains use to communicate. **

Actionable advice: 

**Exercise to keep your mind fit.**

Did you know that our bones release a hormone? It’s called **osteocalcin, **and one of its functions is to promote the production of certain neurotransmitters in the brain, which in turn boost our memory. Scientists think that age-related memory loss could be linked to the decrease in bone density in old age. Since exercise promotes bone density, working out your body might help your mind stay sharp!
