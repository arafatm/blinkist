 (2020) describes the challenges leaders face in an increasingly fast-paced and technologically driven world. It’s the ultimate manual for leaders seeking to improve their leadership skills, embrace new ideas and innovations, and prepare for the future.


# What’s in it for me? Become a future-shaping leader and flourish in an uncertain world.

What does it take to be a great leader? What skills do you need? What approach do you take? 

In bygone days, answering such questions was relatively simple. Our world was considerably stabler, and a business could develop a ten-year plan with clear end goals – and then simply stick to that plan. Leaders could concentrate on devising strategies and getting people to execute them without worrying too much about unforeseen obstacles.

Unfortunately, this leadership approach doesn’t quite cut it anymore. We’re living in a world of relentless political, social, and economic uncertainty, which affects businesses of all sizes, from large corporations down to budding start-ups. 

Not only that, but global society is experiencing a huge digital and AI revolution. If leaders want their businesses to survive these uncertain times, they’ll have to take charge of their own destiny and become shapers of their own future. 

In these blinks, you’ll learn

- the fundamentals of future-shaping leadership;
- how to forget the finicky details, see the bigger picture, and set clear goals; and
- why cultivating resilience is good for business.

# We live in an uncertain world, and businesses are under threat.

Perhaps it goes without saying, but the world we live in is increasingly unstable. At times, it can feel overwhelming just watching the morning news, with its headlines about climate change, corruption, terrorism, populism, and other global ills.

Compounding this unsettling instability, rapid advances in technology are changing – well – everything. 

**Here’s the key message: We live in an uncertain world, and businesses are under threat.**

Global society is entering the **fourth industrial revolution** – an age defined by new scientific and technological breakthroughs. These breakthroughs include artificial intelligence (AI), blockchain technology, and precision medicine, each of which is transforming our world in a number of ways.

For starters, these new technologies are **disrupting **industries. For example, the emergence of digital banks in the financial industry has forced traditional banks to upgrade their online services in order to compete.

Then, there’s AI – self-driving cars, for example – which is challenging and changing how we live and work.

While the digital revolution promises endless opportunities for businesses, it’s also created a feeling of global instability. Technology is unsettling territory: it poses new risks, raises ethical concerns, and serves as a reminder of the future’s unpredictability. 

That’s why being a leader in 2020 is tougher than ever. CEOs and management teams are on what the author calls “constant threat alert,” where they have to anticipate changes, be creative, and constantly **pivot** to keep their companies afloat. 

For instance, many brick-and-mortar shops have made their merchandise available online to accommodate their customers’ digital shopping habits. And those shops that haven’t may soon find themselves out of business.

The problem is, if you’re a leader on constant threat alert, you’ll never have the time to step back and learn the leadership skills that will help you navigate today’s relentless, ever-changing business environment. 

For businesses to survive these uncertain times, they’ll need their leaders to take control, empower their teams, and be steadfast in the face of overwhelming challenges.

# To be a future-shaping leader, you need to define your long-term vision.

Let’s begin with a story about a great leader in history. 

In the early 1960s, American president John F. Kennedy had a vision. In a simple sentence, Kennedy communicated what he wanted to achieve: “To put a man on the moon by the end of the decade.” 

Kennedy’s vision was certainly ambitious. But that’s not what made it effective. Read it again. There’s no ambiguity, no vague talk of “the future.” Kennedy not only made clear **what **he wanted to do but by **when** he wanted to do it. Yes, his goal was ambitious. But, more importantly, it was **specific**. 

**Here’s the key message: To be a future-shaping leader, you need to define your long-term vision.**

What Kennedy might have called a “vision,” the author calls a **preferred future outcome,** or **preferable** for short. And, as you just learned, when identifying preferables for your business, the key is to be specific. For example, it’s no use saying that you want to “change the world” or “make a difference.” These goals are too broad. Where would you even start?

All this advice might sound obvious. But you’d be surprised how many leaders set vague goals that leave their employees feeling confused about what they’re working toward. This is mostly because leaders are so fixated on the details – resolving day-to-day issues and planning for the worst-case scenario – that they fail to look at the bigger picture. 

If this sounds like you, try hitting pause for a moment. Step back and ask yourself **why** you’re a leader. What motivated you to step into a position of leadership? What long-term impact are you trying to have? How can you measure your success?

Henry Ford, the founder of Ford Motor Company, is a good example of a leader who had strong answers to such big-picture questions. Right from the get-go, he had a clear and purposeful preferable in mind: to provide affordable mobility to the masses. He also knew **why **he wanted to achieve this aim – he cared deeply about building a motor car that was suitable for everyone. 

If you, like Ford, can identify a preferable and state why you want to achieve it, then your employees will always know **what** they’re working toward and **why. **And you will have the time and mental space to marshall your resources and lead the way.

# The best way to figure out your goals is to ideate without limits.

Imagine you’re an artist sitting in front of an easel. Before you is a blank canvas and, to your right, is a collection of paints and brushes. In this moment, there are no rules: you can paint whatever you like. It’s this freedom – the boundless potential of that blank canvas – that enables artists to be creative.

Like artists, future shapers seeking creative solutions also need freedom. In fact, when figuring out what your vision is for the future, it’s best to let your imagination run wild – and to set aside your concerns for **how **you will implement it. 

**Here’s the key message: The best way to figure out your goals is to ideate without limits.**

This approach has generated many breakthrough ideas. Take the example of self-driving cars. The idea that an automobile could drive itself without a person behind the wheel was, at first, just a desirable outcome. Now, driverless cars are on the verge of becoming a widespread reality. 

We can also look to artificial intelligence for examples. Robots were once nothing more than a fanciful idea – but, today, humanoid robots are functioning as customer-service terminals in airports and even serving as TV news anchors in China. 

This goes to show that when you imagine what your destination is – and you temporarily shelve your concerns about how to get there – you give yourself the freedom to imagine the wildest possibilities. 

Imaginative freedom is crucial. But it won’t take you far unless you also fuel your imagination. And this requires getting out of your own “echo chamber” and embracing new points of view. 

You can do this by finding ways to meet people from different cultures, industries, and professional backgrounds, and then listening carefully to their ideas and experiences.

Next up: take note of the zeitgeist. Consider what patterns and trends are emerging worldwide, and keep a close eye on what consumers want. Also, keep up to date with the latest innovations in technology. Tapping into new ideas as soon as they emerge will help you stay ahead of the curve.

As a final tip, carve out some time in your day to declutter your mind and allow yourself to daydream. With a clear mind and a blank canvas, and the freedom to simply **create**, you might just come up with your best idea yet. 

# To earn support, leaders must communicate a clear vision and provide a roadmap for how to get there.

In the early 1990s and the decades before that, the world of business looked much different than it does today. Back then, it was typical for business leaders to sit at the head of a long boardroom table, giving out instructions and assigning tasks. Leaders were king – or queen – of their corporate domain. 

This model has changed entirely. Today, the old “command and control” style of leadership no longer works. There are two reasons for this. First, employees are more empowered, educated, and autonomous than ever before. Second, traditional corporate hierarchies have been flattened. In other words, companies function less like monarchies and more like democracies.

What does this mean for leaders? Well, if you want to turn your preferable into results, you’ll need the support of a good team – but you’ll have to **earn **that support. 

**Here’s the key message: To earn support, leaders must communicate a clear vision ****and provide a roadmap for how to get there.**

So how do you earn support?

Start by laying out your preferable. Clearly and concisely, explain what it is and why it’s important for the company to achieve it. Try showing your potential followers a real-life example of what you’re trying to achieve. Perhaps you have an existing example from another industry that you can use – or maybe you could make one up to illustrate what you’re aiming for.

It should be absolutely clear how achieving your preferable will change the company, and why that change will be for the better. 

Remember to use powerful imagery to spice up your pitch. Research has shown that people are more likely to be persuaded by something they can visualize. Stories that involve relatable characters will make your preferable easier to understand and inspire your listeners.

Now that we’ve touched on how to communicate the “what,” let’s take a look at ways to communicate the “how.”

For starters, you’ll need to give your followers a step-by-step plan of how to achieve the desired outcome. You’ll also need to communicate what resources you’ll need to support you in this process – whether that’s additional finances, equipment, or manpower. 

A key thing to remember is that people resist change unless they’re certain that the result of the change will be worth the effort. So instead of overwhelming people with your enthusiasm, allow them to absorb your ideas, ask questions, and think about how they can support you.

# Build a creative and resilient team via diversity and inclusion.

Imagine two teams. One is diverse. It consists of men and women, black people and brown people, younger people and older people. The other team is homogenous – a group of men, most of them white, all about 40. Some people might find this surprising, but the diverse team consistently outperforms the homogenous team, despite its members having far fewer commonalities. Why?

**Here’s the key message: Build a creative and resilient team via diversity and inclusion.**

Before exploring why diversity improves performance, let’s talk about what diversity is.

If you work in a big corporate firm, you’re probably familiar with the term **diversity and inclusion**. This phrase describes what strategies and practices a business has in place to support an inclusive workplace. For example, the company may have initiatives to increase the proportion of women in senior management roles, or it may give workshops on how to reduce stereotyping at work. 

When it comes to the recruitment process, hiring for diversity means recruiting people of different races, ethnicities, genders, sexual orientations, and even educational backgrounds – which should be high on any business’s agenda to ensure equality. 

Most people would agree that equality is a good thing. But why** **is it good for **business**? Well, there are two reasons. First, diverse teams tend to be more resilient. Just as a person who’s had many experiences is better prepared to handle the unexpected, a diverse team is more likely to have the tools to cope with instability and change. Second, diverse teams tend to be more innovative. This is because individuals from different cultures and with different experiences expand the range of a company’s ideas and improve its ability to solve problems. 

So having a diverse team is undoubtedly a good thing, but, unfortunately, it can’t happen overnight. 

Leaders will need to work hard to embed inclusion into their hiring practices. They’ll also need to foster a team culture that is fundamentally conducive to embracing new ideas. One way to do this is to encourage open communication in the workplace and allow everybody in the room to speak up and offer their input. 

More importantly, diversity and inclusion shouldn’t just be seen as a “special project” or an HR initiative that’s nice to have. Instead, leaders should view inclusion as an essential part of their business strategy. 

# Cultivate connections to establish your platform.

Meet Sanjay. He’s a senior commercial lending manager in a bank, and he’s had a brilliant idea. Sanjay has observed that his bank is comfortable lending money to bigger businesses, but it’s unwilling to fund entrepreneurs. Fully aware that Apple and other major global businesses began as scrappy start-ups in need of capital, Sanjay decides that he wants to incubate an “entrepreneurial bank for entrepreneurs.”

But then Sanjay encounters a problem – a platform problem.

**Here’s the key message: Cultivate connections to establish your platform.**

If you want to set your future-shaping idea in motion, you’ll need to find a way to make your voice heard. The best way to do this is to establish what the author calls a **platform**. What exactly is a platform? Imagine you’re giving a speech in public. You need a stage, right – a place where people can see you and hear you.

Well, your platform is your stage.

So how do you go about building a platform? Well, the first step is making connections. This involves identifying people who can help you facilitate your future-shaping vision, and then putting in the work to build a good relationship with them. If you don’t do this, your idea may never even get heard.

And that brings us back to Sanjay and his platform problem. He didn’t have any connections to help him make his idea a reality. While he knew the name of the CEO of the bank he worked for, he couldn’t name any of the company’s leaders at the next level down. 

At this point, Sanjay wished he had invested more time in fostering a good relationship with his boss, with his boss’ boss, and with other influencers in the organization. It didn’t much matter that he had a great idea because he had no platform where he could share it.

So powering up your network early on is crucial to getting your ideas heard. Start by considering who you want to connect with and why – and what skills or connections you have that could benefit them. The key is to demonstrate that you can add value to this person. Then they might just help you get your idea off the ground.

# Being a happy and energized leader creates an optimal atmosphere for great work.

As a leader, you’ll always have a team of people depending on you for direction. If you’re lackluster about your goals, it won’t only affect your own level of motivation, but that of your employees, too. 

Employees, whether consciously or unconsciously, tend to copy the mood and behaviors of their leader. For example, if you walk into the office with a thunder cloud above your head, it’s likely your employees’ moods will turn gray, too. On the other hand, if you can put your worries aside and be consistently motivated and energized, your team’s productivity will be positively affected as a result. 

**Here’s the key message: Being a happy and energized leader creates an optimal atmosphere for great work.**

As a future shaper, it’s your job to inspire people to bring their A-game. If you can see your team’s motivation flagging, consider the following questions: Am I taking the time to listen to my employees’ ideas and concerns? Am I appreciating them for their hard work? Am I bringing enough positivity to the workplace?

If the answer to these questions is no, then set aside some time to address these problems. For example, simply letting your employees know that your door is always open – just in case they need anything – can help them feel happier and more secure in their roles. 

Another key thing to remember is that all leaders – even future-shaping ones – are human. And they need time to rest and recuperate, just like everyone else. That’s why it’s important to have a good support system of friends, family, and colleagues who can help and nurture you in times of need. 

Also, a good self-care routine is a must. Future shapers know that a healthy body and a healthy mind are crucial to setting clear aims, and to achieving them. In addition to following all the usual advice – get enough sleep, eat your greens, make time for exercise – it’s also crucial to sustain a positive outlook.

Whatever it takes for you to do that, make sure to keep your intrinsic mission in mind. This will help you perform your role in a way that is meaningful to you. 

# Be persistent to survive today’s volatile business environment.

Steve Jobs. His name has become synonymous with success, innovation, stylish design – all the things that businesses yearn to achieve. But a major chunk of his career was defined by failure.

In 1976, he started Apple, which got off to a good start. But after an unsuccessful product launch in 1985, he got kicked out of his own company. Then he founded a new company called NeXT.

NeXT was unsuccessful from the very beginning, and it remained so until Apple bought it. But that didn’t happen until 1997 – 12 years after Jobs founded NeXT. Twelve years! Why, in all that time, didn't Jobs give up? The answer is one of the keys to success.

**Here’s the key message: Be persistent to survive today’s volatile business environment.**

In business as in life, persistence is all about moving forward, looking for solutions, and working toward success. It’s also about retaining your resolve when the going gets tough. 

A lot of being persistent comes down to being confident. Steve Jobs was successful because he believed in himself, despite the odds.** **He simply didn’t quit. He knew that, if he didn’t believe in himself, no one would.

The problem is, there’s not really a step-by-step manual to building self-belief. It’s not necessarily a quality you’re born with; it’s something that you have to learn and work on throughout your career. 

You can start by developing a few confidence-boosting strategies for when you’re feeling low. For example, remind yourself of your leadership purpose. Ask yourself what compelled you to lead and why leadership is important to you. It might also be helpful to come up with your own personal mantra to keep you consoled and motivated during tough times – something like “Just keep moving forward” or “This too shall pass.”

Being confident is what will give you an edge as a future-shaping leader. It will help you think big, be assertive, and make the best decisions for your business.

# 

**“Success doesn’t happen because of what you know, it happens because of who you become.”**

# Final summary

The key message in these blinks:

**No leader can predict the future. But they can help to shape it. In an increasingly uncertain world, it’s up to you to decide the kind of future you want to create, and the strategies for how to get there. In addition to motivating your team, keeping a close eye on current developments, and establishing clear aims, it’s important to have self-belief. If you don’t have confidence in yourself and your ideas, then it’s likely no one else will.**

Actionable advice:

**Be a doer, not a talker.**

Everyone loves to hear about new ideas and future possibilities. But if leaders are all talk and no action, it’s unlikely they’ll gather the support of their team. So next time you step on the podium to tell your employees about your vision, make sure you have a clear action plan of how to deliver it. This will help you build a reputation for being a reliable and results-driven leader, rather than a preacher of empty words.
