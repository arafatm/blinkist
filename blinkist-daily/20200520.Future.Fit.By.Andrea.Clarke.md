(2019) is a guide to remaining relevant and employable in the future. As technological change and new employment models shape the workplace in often unpredictable ways, we risk being left behind if we don’t keep up. This book provides key insights into what the employees and leaders of the future must do to stay ahead.


# What’s in it for me? Get yourself fit for the future of work.

Have you ever worried that you’ll be left behind by the pace of change? That, someday, you’ll be just like one of your technophobe relatives, fumbling over a new phone or scratching your head at a laptop screen?

Well, when you consider how the future of work is shaping up, perhaps you’re right to be concerned. As AI is incorporated into the workplace and traditional employment models are transformed, we all need to keep abreast of new developments. To stay relevant means understanding these changes **before **they happen, and responding to them proactively.

Happily, there are things you can do to prepare for the future. In the following blinks, you’ll discover which new skills and qualities are going to be at a premium in the coming decades, and what you can do to maximize them. You’ll learn how creativity will be king, how leadership will have to adapt, and how your ability to communicate will get you ahead. To steel yourself for change, get into the blinks for **Future Fit**.

You’ll discover

- how your “personal brand” will be as important as your CV;
- what Igor Stravinsky can teach us about creativity; and
- how future networking will be more like a school reunion.

# To get ahead in the future, you’ll need to work on your personal brand.

Whether you like it or not, you have a “personal brand.”

But what **is **that exactly?** **Well, it’s the whole picture – from your style of doing things, your values and interests, to how you make people **feel **when they’re around you.

On the face of it, that’s nothing new. What **is** new, though, is how important your personal brand will become in the future, as you attempt to climb the career ladder.

**So, the key message here is: To get ahead in the future, you’ll need to work on your personal brand.**

Things are changing rapidly. Because of technological advances and flexible work arrangements, you have less face-to-face contact with the people who could hire or promote you. So, you’ll need to go above and beyond what’s typically required to catch an employer’s eye. Only those with distinctive personal brands and reputations will stand out above the rest.

In fact, your personal brand will have to define you quickly and effectively, in the same way that a consumer brand does a product. In the future, it’s likely that managers will view a consumer brand and personal brand as pretty much the same thing. The same questions will apply to both: Can they be trusted? Are they offering a valuable product? What makes them different?Do they have the ability to influence?

Naturally, this means you’ll really have to outline what makes you distinctive. To do this, you’ll first need to delve deeper into **who **you are and **why **you do what you do. From an employer’s point of view, there is nothing more powerful and attractive than a person who is completely certain about their career and life purpose.

Put yourself in their shoes.** **Who would you prefer to hire? Someone with just a list of college grades and miscellaneous jobs on their CV, or someone who has already carved out a distinctive niche for themselves and knows exactly what they want from a role? It’ll be the latter person every time. They’re likely to bring real purposefulness and drive, while everyone else is an unknown quantity.

What’s more, when you’re certain about why you’re attracted to your particular career, you’ll be able to communicate it authentically and with real power. You won’t need to pretend. Like a great consumer brand, everything about you will **make sense**.

# To succeed, you’re going to have become a super-communicator.

The future will bring even more advanced technologies, rapid flows of information, and higher levels of uncertainty. 

It’s enough to make your head spin, isn’t it? How can you, a simple **Homo sapiens**, keep up with it all? Quite simply, if you want to stay afloat, you’re just going to have to. 

And one way to keep ahead of the curve is to become a master of communication.

**The key message here is: To succeed, you’re going to have become a super-communicator.**

In this world of the future, you’ll have to process and communicate complex information quickly. There will be continuous disruption and change in most of our activity, so those who’re able to understand and then **convey **new information will be most valued. Those who aren’t able to keep up with all of this flux could become as redundant as minidisc players in an age of digital files.

Sounds daunting, doesn’t it? Don’t worry, though – there are things you can do to prepare. One of those is learning from TV reporters.** **Think about it. A TV reporter will often have to dash into an emerging news story, interpret complex information, and then communicate it with real clarity. On top of that, they’ll have to make split-second judgments about what kind of tone is appropriate for the story, or which bits of information they should omit or include.

Practically speaking, when communicating important info to your colleagues or manager, you could follow the structure that TV reporters use. So, like them, you’d begin with the **headline**.** **That’s **one** bold sentence and idea. It might be a new obstacle for your team, or an important opinion poll that has just been released. 

Next, you’ll present the bulk of the **info **itself. You should present three strong facts about your information, backed up by statistics and data. When you do that, you should **verbally signpost **each fact, for instance: “Problem 1…, Problem 2…, Problem 3….”

Finally, you’ll need to **close out**. This is where you clarify what you want your colleagues or manager to **do** with the information. You’ll want them to remember this last section, so make it clear and impactful. If you require action, then leave them with a sense of urgency. If you’ve brought them a breakthrough of some kind, then make sure you really stress the point. 

Phew. OK, so, the future means that we’re going to have to adapt, and fast. In the next blink, we’ll look at why **adaptability** is so key.

# If you don’t adapt fast, you’ll find it difficult to navigate the future.

Do you have an older relative who flat out **refuses** to keep up with new technology?

If so, you’ll know the score. At some point, they’ll need to convert a document into a PDF, or use an Excel spreadsheet. And inevitably, rather than learning themselves, they’ll just ask **you **to do it.

**The key message here is: If you don’t adapt fast, you’ll find it difficult to navigate the future.**

But it’s not just stubborn relatives who’ll be left behind by new technologies. If we’re not careful, it could be **most of us**. This is because the rate of change is exponentially faster than it has ever been. Why? Well, the groundwork for faster change has already been done; the main technological foundations have been laid.

Consider this: even after the telephone was invented, it took 75 years for landline usage to reach 50 million users. This is because it took a long time for the necessary infrastructure to be installed. By contrast, the game **Pokémon**** Go** reached 50 million users in just 19 days. This was because the game was built on top of other, **exponential **technologies, like mobile phones, the internet, and augmented reality.

In fact, we’re at the point when tech-driven innovation is racing ahead of our own ability to adapt. The CEO of Google’s secret research company, X, Eric “Astro” Teller, recently drew a graph which tracked the development of human adaptability and technological advancement. While the human line moves along steadily, the technology line shoots up and away from the rate of human adaptability. At the point where they diverge, Teller has written, “We are here.”

Happily, there is a way to keep ahead of rapid innovation. There are three main things that you can do. First, you need to **engage**.** **This means keeping proactively engaged with what’s going on – and not just in your own field, but with the world more broadly. Stay interested in technological developments, new ideas, and fresh perspectives.

Second, you should **activate**.** **Simply put, when you feel the winds of change blowing, learn to embrace them quickly. It’s about identifying opportunities that come with change, rather than dwelling on the negatives.

Lastly, **release**.** **This entails** letting go** of anything that might be holding you back. Maybe that’s fear of the future itself. Or perhaps it’s a hang-up about trying something new because you’re invested in the old way. Whatever it is, you need to let it go, open your sails, and catch the wind of the future.

# You need to harness your creativity to survive in the future.

As we innovate faster, we can be sure of one thing. Many of our current jobs will be done better by machines – especially those that are highly repetitive or require data processing.

This poses a question. If machines are better at mechanical and data-processing roles, which human qualities will still be prized?

Arguably, top of the list is **creativity**. It’s one of the things that differentiates us from machines – for now, at least.

**So, the key message here is: You need to harness your creativity to survive in the future.**

Research proves how vital creativity in the corporate world has already** **become. In 2016, the software giant Adobe released global survey findings that revealed some powerful truths.

Adobe found that those who identify as “creators” in the United States, like software developers, architects, or graphic designers, had a household income that was 13 percent higher than noncreators. The survey also found that two-thirds of those interviewed thought that creative people made better leaders, parents, and students. It found that creators were more likely than noncreators to identify themselves with being “innovative,” “confident,” “problem-solvers,” and “happy.”

But, despite all the good news for creators, the survey also found that only 44 percent of respondents were living up to their creative potential. That’s a lot of wasted creativity.

Even if you don’t consider yourself creative, you **do **have a creative side – all human beings do. So what can be done to maximize it? Well, there are three things in particular.

First, **forced adaptation. **When it comes to developing the part of the brain responsible for creativity, one thing that can really speed up the process is doing unfamiliar things. This is a kind of shock treatment to startle your creative faculties into action. Some of history’s great geniuses understood this instinctively, and adopted peculiar routines to help them create. In fact, inventor and Founding Father Benjamin Franklin thought he was most productive when he was naked and cold! And the composer Igor Stravinsky would stand on his head for 15 minutes each morning.

The next thing to keep top of mind is that **visualization** is vital. When you can envision your end goal, your brain’s neural pathways light up as if you were actually **doing** that thing. So, when you imagine yourself giving a rousing speech or winning a departmental award, you’re already halfway there! Visualization helps your brain prepare itself for the work you need to do.

Finally, there’s **emotional regulation. **With so much distracting stimuli in the modern world, you need calm to really focus your creativity. So, try whatever works for you – meditation, mindfulness, or stress management. Clear a space in your mind, then let your creative side run riot.

“**Creativity is the engine of innovation. If we’re to stay relevant, this is a human skill we need to understand and invest in**.”

# Problem-solving will be vital in the future, and there are two things that can facilitate it. 

Creativity is a powerful tool, but this alone isn’t enough to make an impact in the corporate environment. Consider, for a moment, the following scenario. You’ve just had a brilliant idea for a new product or service for your company. Amazing! One caveat, though: for it to become a reality, you’ll need to turn your inspiration into a workable solution.

This is where** problem-solving** comes in. Problem-solving is a superpower that is highly valued by organizations and businesses everywhere, as it** **makes things happen. It turns that squiggly whiteboard sketch into a real product or service. 

The great thing is, just like creativity, problem-solving is a talent we all possess. We’re human beings after all, with remarkably powerful brains. So, how can you and your organization make the most of your problem-solving ability?

**The key message here is: Problem-solving will be vital in the future, and there are two things that can facilitate it. **

To start with, let’s establish that problem-solving thrives off diversity. When we surround ourselves with perspectives that are exactly like our own, our ability to see new solutions diminishes. We easily settle on a consensus, which, half the time, is wrong! Diversity, on the other hand, pushes us toward solutions we might not have seen, simply by forcing us to consider the other side of an issue.

So, in practical terms, how can you link diversity to problem-solving? Number one: when building a project team, or consulting stakeholders, you should make sure that you bring in as many diverse perspectives as possible. This means getting takes from people who are different from you on the grounds of ethnicity, gender, economics, body type, and sexual preference.

Number two: you should adopt a **difference mindset** in all of your interactions. This means interrogating your own assumptions continuously, and forcing yourself to see other facets of a problem. This is also a great way to avoid complacency.

Along with diversity, the other ingredient for better problem-solving is a working environment where you can express yourself freely. We all work better when we can speak our minds without fear, censure, or embarrassment. So, this means nurturing a working environment that prioritizes **psychological safety**. 

When we feel psychologically safe, we’re much more likely to be creative, take risks, and speak up when we see something going wrong. And in a world of rapid technological change and disruption, we’ll need to be at our very best if we’re to be effective problem-solvers.

# To “network” in future, means reaching out to your old friendship groups.

What do you think of when you hear the word “networking?” Perhaps an industry event where you rub shoulders with strangers, trying to give out your business card? Or maybe it’s sending an awkward message on LinkedIn?

Well, in the future, networking might mean something quite different. Moreover, in order for you to prosper, you’re going to need to rethink the way you do it.

**The key message here is: To “network” in future, means reaching out to your old friendship groups.**

Rather than promote yourself to people who know nothing about you, the best thing to do is reach out to your old friends. At this point, you might be thinking, “What relevance do my old friends have to my career?”** **Quite a lot, actually. Many of them will now be moving in different circles, working in different sectors, and living in different regions or countries. You can’t possibly know how useful getting back in touch might be for your career.

Here’s an example: the author, Andrea Clarke – whose career spans TV reporting and humanitarian work, to her current role as a CEO educator – reconnected with an old friend after 25 years. As teenagers, they’d spent their youth in nightclubs and bars in Surfers Paradise, Queensland. It turned out that this friend, Candice Treloar, now worked for the Australian telecommunications giant Telstra. Through this connection with an old friend, the author secured valuable work for her company, CareerCEO.

Crucially, because they already had a long-standing friendship, they could be straightforward with one another. They didn’t need to establish a relationship, or go through the whole rigamarole of corporate “courtship.” Everything is much easier** **with friends.

Another benefit of rekindling friendships is a very human one. In a career market that can seem ever more lonely and isolating, we need all of the practical and emotional support we can get. While there’s great material wealth in the West, depression runs at record levels, and communities are increasingly fractured and alienated from each other. So the benefit of having a close-knit “clan” can’t be underestimated.

We’re social animals after all. For instance, research has shown that many of those who lived through the 1992–1995 Bosnian war are nostalgic for the sense of camaraderie they felt during that conflict. Sadly, they can’t find that kind of community spirit in the present. What does that say about our current age, and where we’re heading? Let’s just say that, to survive the future, you’ll need your** **friends more than ever.

# 

“**Traditional networking is over. The future of work will require our networks to go deeper and go three-dimensional**.”

# The workplaces of the future demand a new kind of leadership.

The workplace is changing. Many of us work from home or have a much looser relationship with the traditional office environment. We work flexibly **and** remotely, dealing with ever more complex technology and information.

As we move forward, then, new types of leadership are needed. Bosses can no longer be the aloof, authoritative “suits” they’ve been in the past. They’ll have to be much more involved, dynamic, and accommodating.

**The key message here is: The workplaces of the future demand a new kind of leadership.**

According to the business professor Jonas Altman, the future will call for **four **different leadership types. These are models and attributes that can be adopted separately or together, depending on the circumstances and the organization.

Let’s look at the first: the **Teacher**.** **The Teacher focuses on leading and educating by example. A Teacher prioritizes transparency, knowledge-sharing, continuous learning, and feedback. Through doing this, they look to encourage a similar mindset among their workforce. Additionally, their leadership model is one that’s based heavily on trust, and treating workers as competent, but accountable, individuals.

Second, we come to the **Learner**. This kind of leadership will be vital as technological change speeds up, and we’ll have to learn on the fly and develop new expertise rapidly. “Learner” leaders understand that it’s not just the employees that have to learn, but the leadership too. They’ll act as conduits, absorbing and synthesizing new technical and intellectual information even faster than their staff.

Next, is the **Mobilizer**. The Mobilizer is the kind of leader who’ll be able to oversee complex processes, involving remote teams and many moving parts. They’ll need to be able to bring others into the fold, to prompt swift collective action from large teams. Simply put, they’ll need to be great at **mobilizing **lots of people.

Finally, we come to the **Giver**. The Giver is the kind of leader who helps others succeed. The best example of one is the CEO of Google, Sundar Pichai. He’s selfless, soft-spoken, affable, and a great collaborator – not attributes you’d immediately associate with someone in his position. But this approach pays off for him and Google. His generosity seems to pervade and light up the organization, encouraging other employees to give, just** **as he does. And, to prove that his approach works, companies with a “giving culture” have reported better profitability, efficiency, and customer satisfaction.

The future is, of course, unknown. But these four attributes would improve any leader, whatever is in store for us in the decades ahead.

# To stay ahead in the future, you’ll need to embrace continuous learning.

We can't be sure what the future will look like, but if it’s anything like the present, it’ll be full of constant disruption and change. Automation, cloud technology, artificial intelligence, and robotics look set to transform the world as we know it.

With that in mind, if we’re to keep up, we’re going to need to upgrade our knowledge as frequently as our devices.

**The key message here is: To stay ahead in the future, you’ll need to embrace continuous learning.**

To prepare for this future, a good habit to get into is lifelong **continuous learnin**g. This means dedicating yourself to finding out about things you know nothing about. In the process, you’ll strengthen your hand when it comes to potential career opportunities, or, at a minimum, you’ll better understand an increasingly bewildering world. To do that, there are four key things you can adopt to get yourself into this habit.

The first of these is to **set clear learning objectives. **This means identifying an area of weakness and filling it in. How? Well,** **let’s, for example, say you don’t have a clue about “fintech,” or what that even means. The most obvious solution is simply to read up on it. Or maybe you know nothing at all about the stock market. Easy – set aside a few hours reading until you do.

Next, you need to **combine old school with new school**. What does this involve, exactly? To begin, every subject has two main parts: the foundational and the new. So, the “old school” component of economics would mean familiarizing yourself with, say, Adam Smith or Karl Marx, whereas learning about the “new school” might mean getting to grips with more recent developments like “proptech” or the “shared economy.” Both sides are crucial to having a holistic understanding of a subject.

Third, **latch onto street smarts. **This means engaging with the present and the most** **cutting-edge wisdom. You might find this while listening to a podcast, hearing a keynote speaker at a conference, or having an email exchange with an expert in the field. This kind of insight builds on the **old school**/**new school **knowledge you’ve already gained.

Finally, **commit to a revision schedule**.** **For many people, this is the tricky part. But to learn properly, you need to commit yourself to doing it at regular intervals. Whether that’s by using flashcards every day to remind yourself of key insights, or setting aside a few evenings a week to read textbooks, revision is a necessity if you want to absorb new knowledge.

And the best part is, even if your new knowledge isn’t immediately “useful,” nobody ever regrets knowing more about the world in which they live!

# Final summary

The key message in these blinks:

**The future looks to be characterized by technological disruption, with radical changes to traditional employment models. To remain relevant, we’ll need to become more adaptable, encourage creativity, and get into the habit of life-long, continuous learning. Furthermore, networking will require reaching out to old friends for advice and support, as society becomes ever more atomized and insular. Finally, in order to adapt, leadership will have to become much more involved, dynamic, and accommodating.**

Actionable advice:

**Read about an unfamiliar topic.**

We all have gaps in our knowledge. So the next time you’re thinking of binging on a Netflix series or scrolling aimlessly through social media, get onto Wikipedia and read about something you know nothing about – maybe about how a volcano functions, or the intricacies of the bond market. Whatever it is, fill that gap!
