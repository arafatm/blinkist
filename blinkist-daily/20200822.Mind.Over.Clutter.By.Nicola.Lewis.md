# What’s in it for me? Come home to peace and relaxation.

Is your home getting you down? Are you dismayed by the state it’s in? 

Many of us dread the moment we’ll step through our front door. We hope that home will be a calm, relaxing place. But instead, we face overflowing cupboards and stuff just strewn across the floor. We tell ourselves we’ll get organized – but life is hectic, and we never find the time. So the mess keeps getting bigger. 

If that sounds familiar, don’t worry! Help is at hand. 

These blinks are your guide to a cleaner, tidier life and to a calmer state of mind. You’ll learn how to declutter your home – stress-free; pick up simple tips to help you get organized – fast; and discover how to maintain your living space in a way that’s healthier for you – and for the planet. 

In these blinks, you’ll learn

- what decluttering can do for your mental health;
- why you should ditch your store-bought household cleaner; and
- how you can give your empty tin cans a new lease on life.

# A cluttered home is a stressful home. 

Do you ever feel overwhelmed by your possessions? Have piles of paperwork, clothes, and household objects taken over your home? If the answer to these questions is yes, then it’s time to declutter both your home and your life! 

Modern living is complicated, and a tidy house won’t solve all your problems. But it can definitely help. That’s because your physical environment has a big impact on your state of mind. Unpleasant surroundings can actually damage your mental health.

A study published in the **Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin **in 2009 showed that living in a cluttered home can raise the levels of the stress hormone **cortisol** in your body. 

**The key message here is: A cluttered home is a stressful home. **

These findings are bad news for untidy people; high cortisol levels can lead to an increased risk of depression and anxiety and can also cause concentration lapses. Not only that, but elevated cortisol is associated with physical problems too, such as headaches and insomnia.

So clutter makes us unhappy. But we still avoid reorganizing our homes. Why? Well, for some people the thought of tackling the mess can seem overwhelming – or perhaps too time-consuming. 

Although the prospect of decluttering might fill you with dread, the good news is that you don’t have to do everything at once! Start by making small, gradual changes, and over time they will make a big difference.

You could start decluttering right in your bedroom. Step one: begin each morning by making your bed. Completing this simple daily task will mean you’ve already accomplished something before breakfast! This will set a positive tone for the day ahead. Even better, research has found that people who make their bed every day are 19 percent more likely to sleep better than those who don’t!

You could then move on to other manageable tasks, such as sorting through your cupboards. Clutter starts to accumulate when you shove items into drawers and forget about them. So every week, set aside a regular time slot to look into your cupboards. Be ruthless, and throw out anything you no longer need. 

But how do you identify the things you don’t need? Well, there’s a simple rule: if an item doesn’t bring you joy, it’s not worth having. So that pair of jeans that no longer fit you? Take a deep breath, and throw them away! 

# Follow a simple four-step decluttering process to transform your home. 

Waking up in a home you love can inspire you to do great things each day. And when you return in the evening, a comfortable home should welcome you with open arms. Transforming your home into this inspirational, welcoming space is easier than you might think. In fact, it only takes four steps. 

The first step is to remove every single thing from the room. No, not the furniture, of course – your wardrobes can stay! This is about smaller items, the little things that pile up to create a big mess. 

Next, you sort through the items and create four separate piles. One is for items you want to keep, and the other three are for stuff you’ll donate, sell, or throw out. 

**The key message here is: Follow a simple four-step decluttering process to transform your home. **

The first pile, which contains your “keepers,” is only for things that you use regularly – say, at least once a month. Anything else can go. A good tip: if you find anything that’s still in its original packaging, you’ll probably never use it – so don’t keep it. 

After you’ve sorted through everything, it’s time to clean the whole room. Don’t forget the inside of wardrobes and drawers, or high shelves that often get neglected. Now you’re ready to go back to your four piles. Put the things you're keeping back into the room, and organize them carefully. Make sure you find a neat and tidy home for every item. 

When you declutter like this, make sure you include your bedroom. Many people overlook their bedroom – often because it’s the only room in the house that guests don’t normally see. But, in fact, your bedroom deserves special attention. After all, it’s the place where you sleep; a calm and soothing atmosphere is essential!

When you’re organizing your bedroom, make sure you’ve considered storage. It’s important because seeing things like work papers or unwashed laundry can distract you when you’re about to go to sleep. If you’re struggling with finding a good storage spot, try using the space under your bed. You could invest in a divan bed, or use plastic drawers that slide in and out. It’s also a great idea to use antique trunks or ottomans in your bedroom. These unique pieces of furniture will give your room character, are great for storage, and can even be used as bedside tables. 

# You can make your home safer by creating your own cleaning products. 

Your home should be your ultimate safe space. But, worryingly, our homes have become distinctly unsafe. And that mostly comes down to how we clean them. Many of the common household cleaning products are packed with toxic chemicals. These chemicals are called **volatile organic compounds**, or VOCs. And they can be disastrous to your family’s health. 

Volatile organic compounds release invisible gases into the air. Unfortunately, these gases hang around for a long time after you’ve finished cleaning. The result? For some people – especially children – this exposure can cause liver and kidney problems and can even damage their nervous system. In fact, cleaning products with VOCs are so bad that they often make the air inside your home more polluted than the air outside! 

You can avoid VOCs and their associated health problems altogether. The solution is to clean your home with natural products. 

**The key message here is: You can make your home safer by creating your own cleaning products. **

It might sound strange, but you probably already have everything you need to make your home sparkle again. For example, lemons are great for cleaning and freshening up dirty surfaces. Their antibacterial qualities mean they work really well on kitchen countertops, and the juice gets rid of water marks and limescale from your taps and shower curtains. 

Vinegar is also antibacterial, and it’s great for eliminating bad odors. Just mix some white vinegar with an equal amount of water, and there you are – you now have a fantastic kitchen cleaning solution! The vinegar will also prevent any mold from growing in your refrigerator. And it’s perfect for getting your glassware sparklingly clean. Just use some white vinegar in your dishwasher instead of the rinse aid. 

Baking soda can also help you make a natural cleaning solution. Mix it with lemon juice, and you’ve got a great cleaner for dirty dishes. Or add a cup of baking soda to your next white laundry load to make your whites even brighter. For best results, mix the baking soda with your usual cleaning detergent. 

Finally, if you’re looking for a natural yet effective way to remove stains from the bathroom, then your answer could again be – baking soda! This time, just mix it with some white vinegar.

If you need extra motivation to make your own cleaning products, then just consider the environmental impact of all those shop-bought cleaners. Shockingly, every plastic spray bottle you buy takes two centuries to decompose!

# Consider the environment before you throw out your clutter.

How can you make your home a better place while also making our planet a better place? We live in a consumerist society, and our shopping habits are having devastating consequences. Whenever we indulge in shopping therapy, we contribute to global warming, polluted oceans, and growth of toxic landfill sites. Our insatiable hunger for new products is taking a heavy toll on the natural world. 

But don’t lose hope. You may have been part of the problem, but you can become part of the solution. The answer is to find new ways to use what you already have. Repurposing things in this way is known as **upcycling**. For instance, instead of throwing empty tin cans in the recycling bin, why not use them to grow herbs or flowers on your windowsill? You could even paint those cans your favorite color and use them to store your cooking utensils. 

**The key message here is: Consider the environment before you throw out your clutter.**

When you’re decluttering your closet, don’t throw out old t-shirts. Instead, cut them up and use them as dustrags. If an unwanted shirt has an especially attractive pattern, you can transform it into a pillowcase or make a patchwork quilt from it. 

Even the smallest things can have a new lease on life. Let’s look, for example, at something as simple as the cardboard insert from toilet roll. Completely useless, right? Well, maybe not. Those little tubes can help keep your TV and electrical wires separate and orderly. Stand the rolls upright in a shoebox and house your cables in them. 

You can even reuse your empty egg cartons to plant your own miniature herb gardens! 

And don’t even think about throwing out your old lightbulbs if you have young children – decorating those little glass spheres with paint can turn them into Christmas baubles and make a fun holiday activity.

Even when you're not upcycling, you can still declutter your home in a way that’s kind to the environment – and to your wallet.

Rather than destroying your broken, old smartphone and buying a new model, why not trade it in? There are lots of companies that will take your old products and offer you cash toward something new. Not only will you make a bit of money, but you’ll also know that your stuff will get properly recycled – a win-win situation!

# Decluttering your suitcase makes packing a lot easier. 

How do you pack for your vacations? If you’re anything like most people, packing for your dream trip can easily turn into a nightmare. What should you take? Have you packed enough clothes? How do you make sure you haven’t forgotten anything important? There’s so much to think about, which is why packing can drive anybody mad. But don’t panic! You can take your decluttering tips and tricks to the airport, too. 

An organized approach toward packing starts with making a comprehensive list of all the items you’re going to need.

Break this list into different categories – for instance, clothes and shoes, accessories, toiletries, sports, essentials, and entertainment. 

**The key message here is: Decluttering your suitcase makes packing a lot easier. **

Making this list might sound time-consuming. But actually, in the long run, it will save you lots of time. Write it out once, and in the future you can simply adapt it whenever you go away. It will become your master list!

When it comes to the act of packing, give yourself plenty of time. If you leave it till the night before, you’ll be rushed and stressed. So try starting at least two days before your trip. 

When you’re thinking about what to take with you, try arranging your clothes into outfits. This means coordinating everything down to accessories like shoes, jewelry, and scarves. You might even want to think about when you’ll wear each outfit – some colors might work better toward the end of your trip, once you’ve gotten a tan.

It’s also a good idea to pack your holiday clothes into vacuum bags. Not only will your clothes take up less space in your suitcase, but you can also use these bags at home. They’re handy if you need to protect your garments from moths. 

You can keep your clothes smelling great on the journey by sprinkling a few drops of your favorite essential oil onto a piece of cloth and putting it in your suitcase. 

If you really want to avoid clutter while you’re away, consider going digital. Don’t lug heavy books around; instead, put your beach reads on a Kindle. And you can always store maps, travel guides, and entertainment on a smartphone or tablet. 

Decluttering doesn’t need to be complicated. With a little imagination and planning, you can make everyday tasks more manageable – and simplify both your home and your life. 

# Final summary

The key message in these blinks is:

**A cluttered and chaotic home is more than just annoying; it’s damaging to your mental health. But getting organized is easy when you have a plan. Using a simple four-step process, you can free yourself from the possessions that are weighing you down and embrace the things you love instead. With a little forward thinking and some clever hacks, you can enjoy a tidier, more peaceful home – and you can give yourself peace of mind too! **

Actionable advice:

**Motivate your child to tidy their bedroom.**

Our children’s bedrooms are often the messiest part of the home. You can motivate your kids to be neat and tidy by involving them in decluttering. Encourage them to take ownership of the tidying. Ask them where they think would be a good place for each of their toys to live. Let them choose where to store their belongings. Asking your child for their opinion lets them know that you respect their personal space. It works much better than simply ordering them to tidy up, or cleaning up their mess for them.
