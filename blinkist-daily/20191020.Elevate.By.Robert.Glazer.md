(2019) is a manifesto for aspiring high-flyers looking to achieve more. Divided into four core competencies, these blinks provide a wealth of actionable advice on boosting your spiritual, intellectual, physical and emotional performance. Focusing on these areas, Robert Glazer argues, is a guaranteed method for taking your personal and professional life to the next level. 


# What’s in it for me? A four-step plan to unlocking your hidden potential.

What do you see when you look at the top achievers in your field or industry? Are they lucky or uniquely gifted in ways you aren’t? Well, probably not. What they most likely **do **have is a proven recipe for success. The trick is simply choosing the right cookbook. 

Luckily, you’ve already done that. In these blinks, we’ll break your performance down into four key areas or “capacities” – spiritual, intellectual, physical and emotional. Think of them as tools that, when used together, will see you through any project. 

This is valuable because life is full of demanding long-term projects. Whether it’s your personal life and its many relationships or your career with its numerous challenges and hurdles, success is the fruit of patience, diligence and flexibility.

In these blinks, you’ll also learn 

- how to gain clarity on your mission in life; 
- why mornings are the best time to start building new routines; and 
- why your brain suffers when you don’t take care of your physical health. 

# Building capacity is the key to self-improvement and high achievement.

Do you want to improve yourself and achieve more? Great – you’re in the right place! Let’s kick things off with the two most important words in these blinks: **building capacity**. This is about continually learning and honing new skills that allow you to elevate yourself and grow. What it **doesn’t **mean is simply doing more things – you also have to do the **right **things. 

There are four principal areas when it comes to building capacity. The first is **spiritual capacity**. This is about focusing on getting to know yourself and clarifying your values and desires. Next up is **intellectual capacity**. This includes how you think, plan and execute with maximum efficiency and discipline. Then there’s **physical capacity **– your physical health and well-being. Finally, there’s **emotional capacity**. That’s your ability to deal with challenging situations and get the most out of your relationships. 

One way to visualize these areas is as a ball divided into four chambers, each of which can be filled with gas. The 2D version of this ball would look like a pie cut into four quarters. The more air you pump into each of these chambers, the more momentum the ball will have as it moves. But here’s the catch: if you’re not filling each chamber with the same amount of gas, the ball will start to wobble and go off track.

It’s the same with your capacities. All four need to be **balanced**. This means developing them simultaneously with equal care and attention. 

Now, building capacity isn’t something that happens overnight. It’s like working out. Sure, you have to be motivated to book your first gym session, but that’s just the start. If you want to build muscle and get that washboard stomach, you need to be hitting the gym week after week and improving bit by bit. 

Building capacity is just like that – after all, achieving big goals takes time and dedication. Most importantly, it means taking those small steps that will carry you over the finish line every day. Sometimes, the process takes months; other times, it’s a matter of years. Stick at it, though, and you’re sure to realize your dreams.  

So, now that you know how to build capacity in theory, let’s take a look at what you need to do in practice. 

# Spiritual capacity involves figuring out what you want and aligning your actions accordingly.

Building capacity isn’t something you can do willy-nilly. Before you start expending your time and energy, you need to be clear about what it is you’re trying to achieve and why. That’s exactly what “spiritual” means in this context – it’s about figuring out who you are and what you want. Think of it as a compass that will keep you on course and ensure you’re using your resources to get to where you want to go. 

So here’s the million-dollar question: how do you do that? 

Well, if you want to define your core values, you need to ask the right questions. This means taking time to reflect on what’s most important to you. Ask yourself what makes you feel happy and energizes you, and also what gets you down and saps your energy. In other words, when do you succeed and when do you struggle? 

The next step is to reach out to friends, family members and colleagues and ask them how they see things. Here you’ll want to compare your answers with theirs to make sure you’re seeing things clearly. Then, you’ll want to take all those answers and look for common words. Maybe “compassion” crops up repeatedly, or maybe “independence” is a running theme. Whittle down that list to just four or five key concepts. These are your **core values **– the principles by which you want to live. 

That brings us to your **core purpose**. This is your mission in life. It combines your values and gives you a clear sense of where you’re going. The author, for example, defines his purpose as “finding a better way and sharing it,” and it’s this that motivated him to write his book. 

Take a moment to examine your values and then see if you can form a sentence that represents your long-term direction in life. If you’re struggling to do that, try writing your own obituary. It might sound a little macabre, but this is a great way of getting out of your head and asking yourself how you’d like others to see you. That will likely contain vital clues about your core purpose. 

The last step is to begin aligning your actions with your values and purpose. This is all about putting your energy in the right place. True success is the fruit of this alignment. Fail to do that and your success won’t be defined by you but by others. 

# Build your intellectual capacity by adopting a growth mindset, and then find mentors and routines to help you. 

If you’ve updated your computer software recently, you’ll know how much more efficiently and smoothly applications run when you give them a bit of TLC. The same thing happens when you work on your intellectual capacity. The more time you put into it, the more tasks you’ll accomplish while expending the same amount of energy. 

The key to building that capacity is a **growth mindset**. People who adopt this attitude reject the **fixed mindset** – the idea that our intellectual capacity is fixed at a predetermined point. This is all about embracing the fact that it’s never too late to learn new skills and that mistakes and failures are simply part of the process. 

The growth mindset is vital to your efforts to expand your intellectual capacity, but it’s not something you can cultivate on your own. That brings us to the second step: finding mentors who will help you keep learning and growing.

The world’s high-flyers and top performers all have one thing in common: they surround themselves with coaches and mentors who challenge them to keep improving. These people are so important because they don’t tell you what you **want **to hear – they tell you what you **need **to hear. They pull you up on avoidable mistakes and point out how you can achieve more. 

That’s vital because we’re all short-sighted when it comes to understanding ourselves. Sometimes, you need an objective outsider to tell it like it is. 

Finally, you’ll need to use routines to set yourself up for success. Routines are important because they help you make a habit of being productive. That’s crucial when it comes to achieving long-term goals like learning a language or writing a book. 

The best time for this is the morning. It’s as simple as waking up 15 minutes earlier than usual and using this extra time for quiet, focused work. Once this habit has been consolidated, you can start adding extra minutes to your routine. What, for example, would happen if you got up a full hour before your family and used the time to meditate, work out and jot down ideas for your book? 

These are small tweaks to your daily schedule but, cumulatively, they can add up to life-altering changes. 

# Build your physical capacity by eating well, managing your stress, getting enough sleep and embracing competition.

Physical capacity is about more than just being able to run a marathon. When your body is in poor shape, your brain also suffers: you’re more easily distracted, less resilient and more likely to be knocked back by stress and setbacks. That means it’s time to start looking after your health. 

Let’s start with what you eat. The key point here is to make sure you’re getting a balanced and nutritious diet. Highly processed junk food is everywhere today and, in many countries, people are more likely to die as a result of obesity than they are from starvation. But with so many different kinds of diets out there, it’s often hard to choose what’s right for you. Is paleo better than keto, for example? Or is low-carb preferable to slow-carb? 

Well, let’s make things easier with a tip from author and journalist Michael Pollan. His rule of thumb is simple: don’t eat anything your great-grandmother wouldn’t have recognized as food.  

Next up: managing stress. Stress isn’t necessarily a bad thing – in fact, it was stress that ensured our ancient ancestors were alert and attentive enough to spot dangers. Unfortunately, our brains respond to our frenetic, digitalized world in much the same way as they would to snakes and tigers. This means that many of us are regularly experiencing more stress than we can cope with. 

According to Dr. Heidi Hanna, the most effective way to reduce stress is to take regular short breaks throughout the day. These allow you to take a deep breath, relax or even meditate. Getting enough sleep is also essential to your performance levels and well-being, so make sure you’re spending a good 6-8 hours in the Land of Nod each night. 

And here’s one last tip: embrace competition. This has become something of a dirty word, but it’s important to remember that competition shouldn’t be about crushing your opponents and winning at all costs. What it really means is going the extra mile and challenging yourself to become better. Whether it’s intellectual or physical competition, it will push you to build your capacity. 

# Build your emotional capacity by stepping outside your comfort zone and seeking elevating relationships.

Finally, we come to emotional capacity – the tool you’ll use to navigate your relationships both with yourself and others. This has two sides: dealing with people around you and dealing with unintended consequences. Think of driving a car: to do this well, you have to keep an eye on other road users while also anticipating their sudden swerves and stops. 

Building emotional capacity begins by leaving your comfort zone. It’s all too easy to get stuck in a particular mindset, hemmed in by limiting beliefs or the low expectations of others. Overcoming these boundaries is only possible when you set yourself new challenges or allow someone else to push you. If you’ve ever had a colleague or friend tell you something you didn’t want to hear, you’ll know all about this. Sure, it’s uncomfortable at first, but it ultimately motivates you to make improvements. 

Stepping out of your comfort zone also builds your resilience. This is a vital skill. Every day, we face new challenges and situations which can throw us off course. The more resilient you are, the more likely you are to clear those hurdles. 

So how do you do it? Well, it’s as simple as trying new things. You can cook an unfamiliar dish or travel somewhere new, for example. You can also try doing something you usually shy away from, like cold-calling a potential client or giving a colleague some honest negative feedback. 

This isn’t something you can do on your own: to maximize your emotional capacity, you need to surround yourself with the right people. As the author and entrepreneur Jim Rohn once put it, you’re the average of the five people you spend the most time with. That’s why it’s so important to seek out people who share your values, energize you and inspire you to be your best self. 

The flipside of that is avoiding people who undermine you. These are **energy vampires **– so-called “friends” or family members who sap your strength and undermine your effort to improve yourself. Disengage from these individuals and you won’t just feel better – you’ll also have more time for relationships that truly elevate you. 

# Final summary

The key message in these blinks:

**The key to boosting your performance and achieving more is working on four core areas of your life. These are your spiritual, intellectual, physical and emotional “capacities.” How do you do that? Well, the best place to start is clarifying what you actually want in life. Once you’re clear about your goal, you can start honing the skills and abilities you’ll need to reach it **

Actionable advice:

**Protect your mornings by keeping them tech-free. **

The time between waking up and beginning your routine is crucial – it’s literally what sets you up for the day ahead. Unfortunately, our digital devices and gadgets mean we often fail to make the most of this time. Rather than working on our own projects, we waste these precious minutes answering emails or browsing Facebook. But there’s a simple fix: commit to keeping the first hour of each day tech-free. Whether you put your phone in a drawer or use an app to restrict usage is up to you. Either way, you’ll be amazed at how much you can get done when you’re not distracted!
