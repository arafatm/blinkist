# What’s in it for me? Learn how to generate your own good fortune by reframing the world around you.

You may think that every day is pretty much the same as the last. But in reality, the unexpected is happening around us all the time. All you need are the right eyes – and the right mindset – to see it.

This is a mindset based on practical and actionable advice that you can start applying to your life and work today. It’s easy to put on blinders every day and simply get through your workday on autopilot. But this is the kind of mindset that allows so many of us to miss the exciting connections that are waiting to be made every day. And once you start seeing these opportunities, you’ll find that life is full of serendipity, and you’ll never be the same.

In these blinks, you’ll learn

- the three most common types of serendipity;
- how a volcano led to a popular TED conference; and
- how dirty potatoes led to an innovative new appliance.

Last but not least**, **in Blink 10 you’ll find an exclusive Blink on Serendipity in the age of COVID-19. It covers content that’s not in the original book and was created by the author and Blinkist because serendipity now is more important than ever.

# There are several kinds of serendipity, but they’re all different than “blind” luck of the draw – they’re about creating “smart luck.”

What is **serendipity**, exactly? The word itself dates back to 1754 when British writer Horace Walpole used it to describe a kind of discovery that was made unexpectedly, by accident, or through a certain foresighted wisdom known as **sagacity**.

This definition has more or less stood the test of time. For our purposes, we’ll think of serendipity as a positive occurrence, one made when your actions collide with chance. This means serendipity is different from pure chance, or luck on its own.

**The key message here is: There are several kinds of serendipity, but they’re all different than “blind” luck of the draw – they’re about creating “smart luck.”**

Generally speaking, there are three types of serendipity:

The first is **Archimedes Serendipity**. This is when you’re looking for a solution to a specific problem and the solution arrives in an unexpected way. The name comes from the story of how Archimedes solved the problem of King Hiero’s crown. King Hiero was suspicious that his new crown may not be pure gold. So, he called upon Archimedes to come up with a test that would provide an answer.

Archimedes thought it over. And during his brainstorming, he went to the public baths. Here, serendipity struck. Archimedes noticed how the water levels rose as people lowered themselves into the baths. 

He quickly realized that different metals displaced different amounts of water. So, all you needed to do was measure how much water gold would displace, and compare that to how much water Hiero’s crown displaced. If they weren’t the same, then the crown wasn’t pure gold, it would be a fake!

The second type of serendipity is **Post-It Note Serendipity**. This is when a solution is unexpectedly found for a problem that wasn’t even being considered at the time. The name comes from the Post-It note. They were invented when Dr. Spencer Silver, a researcher for 3M, was trying to develop a new type of strong glue. One attempt fell short. It wasn’t very sticky at all. But Silver was curious to discover the potential for this weak glue. It eventually became the perfect ingredient for the Post-It Note.

Finally, there’s **Thunderbolt Serendipity**. As the name suggests, this is when you’re struck by a solution out of nowhere. You weren’t examining any specific problem or researching any particular solution. You were just going about your day when out of the blue an idea and exciting new opportunity presented itself.

Sometimes, serendipity might be a combination or variation of these types. But no matter what, these aren’t cases of blind luck. As we’ll see, hitting upon serendipity is something you can facilitate, as long as you have the right mindset.

# 

**“Serendipity is active, ‘smart’ luck that depends on our ability to spot and connect the dots.”**

# Serendipity is usually about connecting dots that have previously remained elusive.

How we interpret or look back upon serendipity is important. In fact, it can make a big difference in the likelihood of serendipity occurring in the future.

For example, we shouldn’t think of serendipity as a singular event, even if it **is** one of those thunderbolt experiences. Instead, we should think of it as a process. Often serendipity is the result of seeds that were planted weeks, months, or years in advance. And it always requires something of **you** – whether it’s noticing a value that hasn’t been seen before, or drawing a conclusion that hasn’t been reached before.

**The key message here is: Serendipity is usually about connecting dots that have previously remained elusive.**

One of history’s famous accounts of serendipity was the discovery of penicillin. You may be familiar with some of the details: One day, Dr. Alexander Flemming returned to the lab to find that some of the petri dishes had accidentally been left uncovered, sitting on a windowsill.

He’d been working with an infectious bacteria and was surprised to find that the dishes had become moldy, and around that mold, the bacteria had vanished. Now, some doctors would have just focused on the mistake of leaving the dishes uncovered and gotten back to what they were doing in the first place. In fact, other scientists had already noticed that mold could kill bacteria, but they didn’t connect the dots and explore this any further.

But Flemming was curious. He saw the opportunity here. He was open to the possibilities and shared his ideas with trusted colleagues. This curiosity and openness was key to the serendipitous results.

So, this is one of the first things to be aware of when it comes to cultivating the right mindset: being perceptive, curious, open-minded, and eager to see opportunities where others might see only negativity. This also requires an observant and perceptive attitude – the kind that not only notices something unusual, but can connect that bit of information with something else.

# Being attuned and alert to serendipity means letting go of ingrained biases.

Do you ever find yourself being a glass-half-empty type of person? It can happen to the best of us. In fact, having biases and preconceptions goes hand-in-hand with human nature, but that doesn’t mean it’s helpful in life. As far as serendipity goes, having strict, unbending preconceptions can be a big hindrance.

**The key message here is: Being attuned and alert to serendipity means letting go of ingrained biases.**

The author has identified four biases that can stand in the way of serendipity. 

The first is **underestimating the unexpected**. This is the kind of attitude where someone believes life is full of the predictable, the boring, and the expected.

This attitude has been especially prevalent in the business world. Traditional strategy has generally centered around stability, and repeating what has worked in the past. But given the amount of data we now have access to, and how fast things are changing, it’s become clear that no matter how much you try to plan and prepare, the unexpected always happens.

The second bias is **conforming to the majority**. Again, this is a very natural bias to have. It’s safe and comfortable to stick to the majority opinions and ways of doing things. But this can easily lead to a self-censoring herd mentality that isn’t conducive to taking advantage of unexpected developments.

The author works as a consultant for businesses, and one of his practices is to find a high-traffic spot somewhere in an office where he can sit at his laptop and eavesdrop on what people are saying. It might be next to a break room or the water cooler. It gives him a chance to get a sense of what the culture is like at the company. Is it one that promotes free-thinking or stifles it?

If people are getting together and talking about how foolish it was for someone to speak up at a meeting and propose a new idea, then he knows this is a bad culture for serendipity and innovation.

This brings us to the third bias: **post-rationalism**. A big reason for being skeptical about serendipity is that we tend to look back at an unusual occurrence and spin it into something predictable. This is related to “hindsight bias,” and it’s a very human thing to do. It’s more comfortable to think of everything that happens as being a sensible part of an ongoing narrative, not as a bunch of random, chaotic events.

Finally, there’s **functional fixedness**. This is when you develop skills or a certain expertise and that becomes the only way you want to do things. In other words, you want every problem to have one solution. For a good example of this, let’s move on to the next blink.

# Organizations such as RLabs are good examples of having a serendipity mindset.

A great example of the functional fixedness bias is the Western approach to helping out nations that are trying to lift themselves out of poverty. For some humanitarian organizations, there’s only one way of doing things: the Western way. So, if a country doesn’t have the “right” kind of resources, the organization will throw up their hands and say, sorry there’s nothing we can do to help.

Fortunately, not all organizations are so fixed in their thinking. Take RLabs, short for Reconstructed Living Labs, a social enterprise out of South Africa. This is a group of free-thinking individuals who are trying to improve communities in areas like Iringa in Tanzania, and they’re doing it by finding value where others have only seen problems.

**The key message here is: Organizations such as RLabs are good examples of having a serendipity mindset.**

RLabs are not trying to impose a fixed way of doing things on the communities they reach out to. Instead, they come up with ways to work with what’s there, even if it’s abandoned garages and drug dealers. For example, those garages can become training centers and former drug dealers are valued for their resourcefulness and networking skills.

The ability the folks at RLabs have for recognizing unexpected value has far-reaching impacts within the communities they work in. Their methods can inspire, empower, and give people some much-needed dignity. It’s pretty much the opposite impression that some fixed-thinking Western organizations make.

The truth is, there are usually a variety of ways to solve a problem or get something done. This has become apparent in Sub-Saharan Africa when it comes to banking as well. For years, the lack of ATMs and the infrastructure for traditional walk-in bank branches has left multinational banks struggling to make inroads in much of Africa.

But then came the mobile money transfer service MPesa, which essentially takes care of a lot of banking needs, all from the convenience of a mobile phone. Within years of launching, it became the go-to service for millions of Kenyans. MPesa proved that a bank doesn’t always need ATMs in order to be successful. It may seem obvious now, but this is the kind of innovation that successful businesses couldn’t see due to their functional fixedness bias.

# To stay alert and motivated, remain focused on a meaningful north star.

What motivates you on a day-to-day basis? Is it money? Or are you searching for something more meaningful?

There’s a good chance you’ve read or heard something about Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs. This was developed by the philosopher Abraham Maslow over 50 years ago, but it’s left a lasting impression and continues to influence many of today’s social theories.

In short, Maslow’s hierarchy suggests that people are first motivated by basic things like food and shelter. Once that is covered, people are then motivated by sex and relationships, and only later on, when all the lower needs are met, are they concerned with loftier things like existential fulfillment. It sounds logical, but this is an idea that is currently being challenged.

**The key message here is: To stay alert and motivated, remain focused on a meaningful north star.**

These days, it’s not uncommon for young professionals to come out of the gate with their focus on meaning, rather than money. In fact, this shift isn’t isolated to young idealists, it’s something that is showing up across all age groups.

According to Danae Ringelmann, co-founder of the crowdfunding platform Indiegogo, there’s a good reason for people wanting to be purpose-driven rather than money-driven: it feels a lot better and is more rewarding in the long run. As she sees it, putting your true values to the side in order to show up for your day job can be exhausting. It takes energy to hide your true self from nine-to-five every day. The better path is to be authentic, stay true to yourself, and find a way to mix purpose with a paycheck.

This is important for serendipity as well, because an exhausted mind isn’t going to be eager to spot the unexpected and make valuable connections. Instead, it’s the focused mind – one that is fixed on what the author calls a **north star**, or a guiding principle.

Ideally, your north star isn’t a goal you’ll end up reaching before you turn 40, but some ongoing purpose, interest, or curiosity that can continue to inspire you indefinitely. It could be as simple as helping those who are marginalized or disenfranchised.

With your north star in place, your serendipity will always have a purpose – you’ll always have a direction on how to act. So when the unexpected does arise, you’ll be well prepared on how to take advantage of it.

# You can increase the chances of serendipity in simple ways.

At this point, you should have a pretty good idea of the kind of frame of mind that is best for spotting and acting on serendipity. So let’s see what we can do about generating more of it in our lives.

Sure, the whole idea of serendipity is that it’s unpredictable and unexpected, but that doesn’t mean you can’t increase the chances of it being a regular occurrence in your life.

**The key message here is: You can increase the chances of serendipity in simple ways.**

Serendipity is often the result of converging ideas. It’s the spark of unexpected insight that can occur when you mix separate things like, in the case of DaVinci or Steve Jobs, art and science. So, it stands to reason that serendipity is more likely to occur when you increase the number of ingredients or the number of possible combinations.

Let’s say you’re like the author and you want to get into a good university, even though your grades in high school weren’t stellar, to say the least. Nevertheless, you’re eager to continue learning, so you write a heartfelt essay explaining your dreams of one day making a difference in the world.

You could just send this essay along with your application to your top three schools. Or, you could improve your chances by sending it to dozens of colleges. By casting a wider net, you’ll increase the likelihood that your essay will land on the desk of someone who will relate to your story – someone else who struggled in high school but blossomed in college.

Essentially, you want to create possibilities, and you can do this in a number of ways, no matter what your current circumstances are. There are many people who’ve sent out a mass email to everyone in their contact list, or to people they’ve never met, in the hopes of having a serendipitous result. You may be surprised to know how often this works.

Other times, it may be a chance meeting in an elevator or in a Zoom conference, but such encounters require an optimistic willingness to take chances, be sociable, and introduce yourself. Patience is also required. Sometimes, it may take years before the business card you handed someone turns into a case of life-changing serendipity. But as we’ll see in the following blinks, things like that do happen all the time.

# There are easy steps for planting the seeds for serendipity to occur.

Do you remember the Icelandic volcano eruption from 2010? One of the reasons it’s so memorable is that it brought air travel between Europe and the US to a standstill. Due to the amount of smoke and soot in the air, planes were grounded and many people had to suddenly change their plans.

One such person was entrepreneur Nathanial Whittemore. But while some people shook their fist at mother nature for ruining their plans, Whittemore made the most of this unexpected development. He turned it into a great serendipitous opportunity by reaching out to colleagues and people from his networks and quickly putting together the event that became **TEDxVolcano**. This spontaneous symposium on creative entrepreneurship brought together hundreds of experts and featured a livestream that was watched by thousands more.

**The key message here is: There are easy steps for planting the seeds for serendipity to occur.**

How did Whittemore turn a volcanic eruption into serendipity? He was prepared, he recognized the opportunity, and he used the tools he had at his disposal to maximize his efforts.

For starters, Whittemore was part of a strong community. In fact, his reason for traveling in the first place was to be part of the Skoll World Forum, an annual event for social entrepreneurs. He was also an active member on Sandbox, the social platform co-founded by the author and intended to bring people together for exciting collaborations and, yes, to increase the potential for serendipitous innovation. He was also familiar with the people who ran the TEDx events, which certainly helped.

In short, Whittemore had a strong and healthy network of diverse people. This kind of network doesn’t need to be massive, but it does need to be regularly maintained. While conferences and online platforms can be good for establishing casual connections, meaningful ones need to be kept in good condition through periodic emails, conversations, or some kind of communication to make sure they don’t wither away.

One of the good things about well-curated social platforms like Sandbox, unlike the social media platforms where anyone can join, is that the connections come with a certain amount of reassurance that makes them automatically stronger.

But popular social media platforms like Twitter can still be useful for sharing information about your interests and sparking unexpected serendipitous connections. You never know when someone else may notice one of your posts and chime in to provide a thunderbolt moment that could change your life. In fact, we’ll look at such an example in the last blink.

# Serendipity can take time to develop, so patience is often required.

Another characteristic of the serendipity mindset is **grit**, or perseverance. The road to serendipity is often paved with rejection, failed experiments, and near misses. Many entrepreneurs will tell you that they were turned away countless times before they finally found the idea that clicked with investors.

You need tenacity. Not only because it can take time for the right opportunities to present themselves, but because it often takes time for your brain to connect those important dots.

**The key message here is: Serendipity can take time to develop, so patience is often required.**

While having a good supply of diverse people around you can be a vital part of setting the stage for serendipity, it also takes patience and perseverance.

A good example of this is the story of Daniel Spencer. While Spencer had a good job at Apple, his passion was always in photography. Eventually he left Apple in order to pursue photography full-time, setting up a studio called Turn and Shoot Photography.

At first, Spencer was taking traditional high-quality portraits and headshots. But since he had the right mindset for serendipity, he was always curious and observant, looking for unusual signs that may or may not be connected. For example, he noticed that on television and websites there was this trend of rotating photographs that would provide a 360-degree look at things like a new pair of shoes or video game characters.

He was struck by an idea: rotating headshots. He’d had plenty of experience creating actor headshots, and knew that during the audition process, casting directors would often ask actors to turn this way and that. And yet, for some months, he sat with this exciting idea of creating rotating, 360-degree headshots for actors. Like many of us, he was a little scared – what if he went out on a limb with this and it failed?

Then, on Facebook, he saw a promotional contest to win a big, heavy-duty turntable, capable of rotating a standing person. What were the odds? He entered and he won. All the pieces were falling into place. Now he began to test his headshots on friends and reached out to a casting agency that agreed to promote his services on their webpage.

Perhaps the most remarkable thing was that from day one, his business was called Turn and Shoot. It was like it was meant to be.

# Fostering serendipity involves creating a safe space for the mixing of new ideas from diverse minds.

Let’s say you have your own company and want to facilitate as much serendipity as possible. Well, you’re not alone. Increasingly, a lot of businesses are doing just that. They know that things are changing fast these days and relying on stability and consistency just doesn’t make sense anymore.

So, what kind of culture and structures do make sense?

**The key message here is: Fostering serendipity involves creating a safe space for the mixing of new ideas from diverse minds.**

Put basically, you don’t want the kind of company where people are ridiculed for coming up with new or ambitious ideas. You want to create a safe space, where people not only feel free to speak their minds, but where they can also feel free to experiment and fail without fear of being reprimanded or losing their jobs.

This kind of environment often needs to be inspired from the top down. So it’s up to the leaders to tell everyone that the company needs their voices and ideas in order to succeed. If serendipity is to occur, it’s going to require the free sharing of ideas.

Many companies are also forgoing the usual hierarchical structure to empower employees and get them to feel comfortable with making their own decisions. This is also a good move for fostering serendipity, as sometimes the window of opportunity for taking advantage of serendipitous moments is fleeting and requires quick action.

Businesses are also taking down the walls that used to exist between different departments, and perhaps no company offers a better example of this than the animation studio Pixar. Understanding that mixing diverse ideas is key to innovation, the studio was purposefully designed to maximize cross-pollination between the three main departments – animators, executives, and computer scientists. Built around a central atrium, it forces these three departments to mix and mingle every day.

Ensuring your employees can interact and share feedback is vital. But it’s also important to listen to the customer. At a Chinese consumer appliance company, it was customer feedback that led to one of the company’s more unusual serendipitous inventions. It discovered that many people were using its dishwashers to clean potatoes, and then complaining about the problems caused by the dirt build-up this created. But instead of advising people against this activity, it was struck with the idea: why not make an automated vegetable cleaner?

Don’t ignore feedback, even if it’s negative. With the serendipity mindset, problems, complaints, failures, and even active volcanoes can be triggers for the most wonderful and creative outcomes.

# A blink from the author: Navigating COVID-19 uncertainty with a serendipity mindset.

2020 has been a difficult year so far. Physical distancing has robbed us of the many opportunities for serendipity that arise from in-person interactions. Many of the traditional starting points of serendipity – like coincidentally running into someone in the corridor, or the legendary “watercooler moments” – are happening less frequently.

But there’s still a lot you can do to trigger serendipity, which is crucial during times of uncertainty. After all, it’s during uncertain times that many solutions, ideas, and opportunities tend to come from unexpected places.

**The author’s key message in this blink is: In a fast-changing world, cultivating serendipity is an active approach to managing uncertainty.**

So, what can you do to trigger serendipity in these strange times? Here are a few simple approaches to try.

Let’s start with **setting serendipity hooks**. Setting hooks is all about giving people potential dots to connect with. And to help achieve this, you can change the way you communicate and ask questions, especially via Zoom.

For example, when someone asks you during a virtual conference or Zoom call the dreaded “what do you do?” question, you can give them a number of potential “touchpoints.” You can answer along the lines of “I’ve been working on x, recently been interested in y, and just started exploring z.” This opens up potential “ah, such a coincidence, I just started looking into xyz!” moments.

Next, let’s talk about **placing bets **–** **planning spaces for serendipity to occur. Looking for a new job or internship? If you focus on getting a particular job, or doing a particular thing, you restrict your field of possible opportunities or solutions. If you instead look at **all** potential opportunities that could be available to someone with your skillset – and are open to those unexpected ones that someone might tell you about – that’s where the magic happens. A great way to start this is to work on the side with people you admire. This is a fruitful way to put yourself on their radar – and to “be there” once a position unexpectedly comes up.

Let’s move on to **seeding serendipity triggers**. One of the best ways to do this is to identify the people you admire the most and whose contact details you could discover publicly via InMail on LinkedIn, homepages, and so on. Send these figures an honest message on how they have already shaped your life and how you would like them to be part of your journey. If you do this a couple of times – in an honest and non-pitchy way – usually people write back. Some of them might be “coincidentally” working on things that overlap with your skillset, knowledge, or projects.

Finally, it’s vital to take the long view. COVID-19 and the related economic turmoil has been a reminder that we cannot plan everything, least of all our careers. But what will really matter 10 years from now? “Bad luck” often depends on when we stop the story. For example, if a job falls through, we need to take the long view. We should attempt to reframe the situation as an opportunity for growth, for reflection, for change, and for developing resiliency.

Because the space between stimulus and response is where our growth and serendipity lie – in the long run.

# Final summary

The key message in these blinks:

**Optimism. Open-mindedness. Curiosity. Perseverance. Adaptability. These are some of the core qualities of the serendipity mindset. With this mindset, you can seek out and embrace the unexpected and use these unusual moments to make new and exciting connections. When you begin to see the world with this frame of mind, you’ll begin to see that each and every day is filled with the unexpected, and chances to spark new serendipitous ideas and innovations. This holds true for businesses as well. With a few changes to culture and environment, you can begin to set the stage for more innovation and fortuitous events to transpire.**

Actionable advice:

**Create a Serendipity Journal.**

Preparing a** serendipity journal** can help you reflect on situations that were unexpected, how you reacted to them, what to do differently next time. It allows you to reflect on how to explore every conversation or meeting – virtual or in real life – as an opportunity for serendipity to happen.

**Free up creative space.**

You can reflect on your daily routine activities, especially meetings. Which meetings are truly necessary? Do they really need the amount of time they’re allocated? If they’re under your control, can you restructure them to free up creative space?

**Get to know your key multipliers.**

Have you ever mapped out your network? With pen and paper you can create a visual that can reveal the people in your social circles who are most connected. It may be worth your time to strengthen your own connection with these people.

But it isn’t just about the people in your contact list. Oftentimes, it’s the mailman, teacher, rabbi, yoga instructor, bartender, or hairdresser that carries the most social capital in your community. When’s the last time you said hello and struck up a conversation with these highly connected individuals? Let them know about your projects and there’s always a chance that they know someone else who may hold the key to your next serendipitous occurrence.
