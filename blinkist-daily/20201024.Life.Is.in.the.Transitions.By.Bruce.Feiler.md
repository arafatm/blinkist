(2020) is a guidebook to weathering the big changes we may experience in our lives, from getting divorced to starting a new job, from coping with illness to winning the lottery. These major transitions can cause us to feel unstable, uncertain, and overwhelmed. Our lives rarely go as planned, but we can learn to navigate life's changes and better understand what makes them meaningful by changing the stories we tell about ourselves.


# What’s in it for me? Become a master at dealing with change.

“Transitions are coming. Be prepared!” This is how author Bruce Feiler prefaces his book. At the time, he couldn’t have known how prophetic those words would be. Since the outbreak of COVID-19, all of us have experienced disruptions to our lives, be they minor adaptations like working from home, or major crises like bearing up against a serious illness or losing a loved one. 

Whether you’re grappling with the fallout from the pandemic, or dealing with other personal or professional changes, these blinks provide an essential guide to mastering major transitions. You’ll discover that while change can be disorienting and scary, it also provides valuable opportunities to reevaluate what makes life meaningful. 

By applying several key tools, you’ll learn to embrace fear and uncertainty and be equipped to stay grounded in any transition. 

In these blinks, you’ll learn

- why getting a crazy haircut after a divorce is actually a good idea;
- how storytelling can make your life more meaningful; and
- why the myth of a linear life is so harmful.

# Storytelling is a lifeline in a crisis.

What are the stories that you tell about your life? And how do you respond when the “plot” of your life takes a sudden turn that you never chose, and couldn’t have predicted? 

Bruce Feiler was faced with those questions when his otherwise regular life was walloped by a series of personal crises. He was diagnosed with a rare and deadly form of bone cancer. He almost went bankrupt. And to make matters much, much worse, he learned that his father who was battling Parkinson’s disease had repeatedly attempted to kill himself. 

**The key message here is: Storytelling is a lifeline in a crisis.**

Bruce had made a successful career out of writing, but suddenly he felt like he’d lost control of his own story. His father was having the same experience: having Parkinson’s made him feel like his life no longer had any value. Bruce realized that as much as anything, what he and his father were experiencing was a narrative problem: their lives had swerved off course, and they no longer knew how to make sense of their life stories. 

Bruce set out to find what he termed a **narrative solution **and began interviewing his father. He started by asking simple questions like, “What were your favorite toys when you were a child?” When his father responded eagerly, Bruce advanced to more complex questions like, “What is your biggest regret?” 

The process transformed his father’s life – by the end of four years he had written an autobiography and regained the will to live. For Bruce, the exercise was just as transformational. He realized that he’d stumbled upon a much bigger problem: people don’t know how to handle major life transitions because they don’t know how to include them in their life stories. 

Bruce decided that he needed to support his hunch by doing more research. Over the following three years, he traveled across the United States doing interviews for what he called the Life Story Project. By the end of the project, he’d completed 225 interviews with people of all ages and backgrounds. They all had one thing in common: their lives were shaken by unexpected changes, and they were struggling to find a way to make sense of them. In the following blinks, you’ll hear some of their extraordinary tales and learn how stories can guide us through change. 

# We need to stop thinking of our lives as being linear.

What shape has your life story taken? That might seem like an odd question. How can a life have a shape? If we look more closely though, it becomes clear that we tend to think that our lives follow a specific pattern. 

Usually, we think of our lives as being linear. We’re born, we get old, and we have various stages in between. This way of thinking is so entrenched in our culture that it seems completely normal. But in the past, people thought about the structure of life in a completely different way. 

**The key message here is: We need to stop thinking of our lives as being linear. **

Early civilizations in Babylon and Egypt believed that life moved in cycles along with the changing seasons. People were part of the circle of life, repeating the same rituals every year. 

In late antiquity, this changed. People started thinking more linearly, influenced in part by the growing popularity of the Bible, which depicted a linear historical progression through the ages. By the early modern period, this linear conception of life had become cemented, with people seen as partaking in a series of stages, progressing from youth to marriage to old age. 

With the rise of the industrial era in the nineteenth century, people became obsessed with the notion of time. The use of pocket watches became widespread in the 1800s. For the first time people could plan their lives to the minute. 

The notion that our lives follow a linear trajectory has been developed over centuries. The problem is, our lives don’t follow a predictable progression through fixed stages. Unpredictable transitions are the norm, not the exception. And these transitions can happen at any time in our lives. 

Just consider the age range of people having babies, which today typically spans from late teens to early forties. We’re fascinated by the idea of the “midlife crisis,” but who’s to say when exactly that is anymore? 

If change and disruption are actually the norm, we need to think differently about the shape of our lives, and throw away the old idea that they will follow neat, linear paths. We need to come up with some more creative stories.

# Lifequakes shake the foundations of our existence.

Imagine getting married to someone of the opposite sex only to realize that you’re gay. Or imagine discovering that the gender you were assigned at birth doesn’t match who you really are.

As he collected stories of transition, Bruce heard about these kinds of transformations all the time. In fact, he identified 52 kinds of life changes that people experienced time and again. He called them** disruptors, **and categorized them into five key themes: the body, love, work, identity, and beliefs. 

**The key message here is:****** Disruptors****** affect every area of our lives**

Bodily disruptors range from gaining weight to experiencing chronic illness. One woman recounted how her life had been turned upside-down in college when she experienced sudden liver failure and nearly died. Many Americans are familiar with having their lives affected by health scares: six in ten suffer from chronic conditions like heart disease. 

Disruptors in the area of love include all kinds of changes in interpersonal relationships. Some people’s lives change when they have a baby, or need to start caring for elderly parents. Others may get divorced and create a new family constellation. This is an extremely common disruptor. The idea that most people will get married and stay in a fixed family unit is completely outdated. In fact, marriage rates have fallen by two thirds since the 1950s, and most households are headed by single people or unmarried partners.

In the area of work, transition has become the norm. A tenured physics professor who was interviewed for the Life Story Project threw in the towel to pursue YouTube stardom with his band, while a freelance writer was inspired to leave journalism to become a mortician. These aren’t isolated incidents. Statistics show that most people work an average of just four years at each job. Most people will work in at least 12 different positions before turning 50. 

The other kinds of disruptors are in the areas of belief and identity. People may experience changes in religious beliefs or gain new perspectives from earning a college degree. Changes in identity can be sparked by anything from moving cities to reevaluating one’s gender. 

The average person experiences 36 disruptive changes over the course of their lives. Some of them can be easily metabolized, but as we’ll find out in the next blink, some will shake the very foundations of our lives. 

# Lifequakes force us to reevaluate what makes our lives meaningful.

One day, Lisa – a marketing executive – joined a conference call a few minutes early, and heard her colleagues gossiping about her ruthless ambition and sour disposition. The next day, she walked into her boss’s office and quit the corporate job that had been making her miserable for years. She changed careers and became a life coach and then a hypnotherapist, helping other people recover from the trauma she’d experienced for so long. 

That conference call was a turning point that spurred Lisa into action. It created a **lifequake**: a transition that fundamentally transforms how we perceive ourselves and our lives. 

**The key message here is: Lifequakes shake the foundations of our existence.**

Lifequakes can be voluntary events where we choose to transform our lives by making a decisive change and jumping into the unknown. But more commonly, they’re events we have no control over, and don’t choose. For example, a natural disaster or terrorist attack could upend your life overnight. Or you could experience a personal blow like getting laid off. Lifequakes aren’t always negative, though. Some positive changes like buying a house or graduating from college can also be very overwhelming. 

On average, people experience three to five lifequakes over the course of their lives. But what makes some disruptors completely transform our lives, while others don’t leave much of a trace? Well, lifequakes aren’t as much about what happens as they are about the **meaning** that we give to those events. While one person might consider cancer a life-changing experience, others may emerge from treatment with the same lives and world views they had before. 

A lifequake can be created when a disruptor comes along at a bad time, like when we’re particularly tired or vulnerable. A disruptor may also be the proverbial straw that breaks the camel’s back. Lisa didn’t quit her job because her colleagues gossiped about her, but the incident did spur her into action. 

Lifequakes can also happen when there are a pile-up of disruptors occurring at the same time. Very often, trouble arrives in twos and threes. Take for instance a man interviewed for the project who was laid off from his job only to discover his wife was having an affair. The rupture of losing everything at once caused a lifequake.

Lifequakes are by their nature disorientating, and even scary. But they also present opportunities to reevaluate our lives and what makes them meaningful.

 

# We can’t always control disruptive events, but we do control our response to them.

Lifequakes are so disorientating because they shatter the stories we’ve always told ourselves about our lives. People who pride themselves on being a part of a happy family are left at a loss when their partners file for divorce. Career professionals who get their sense of pride from accomplishments at work are left reeling when fired from their jobs. 

To cope with a lifequake, we need to be able to craft narratives that can encompass the complexity of these transitions in our lives. 

How do we do that? Well, to start, we need to get a better sense of what drives us. What makes us feel like our lives are rich, meaningful, and worth living? The answer will differ from one person to another.

**The key message here is: Lifequakes force us to reevaluate what makes our lives meaningful. **

From his research, Bruce identified what he calls the “ABC of meaning.” In this case, ABC stands for autonomy, belonging, and cause. For some people, having a sense of independence and being in control of their lives is the most important driver of the decisions they make. For others, having a sense of belonging within a community is most important. Those who are motivated by a cause feel that their lives are only really meaningful when they are contributing to a bigger mission, and helping to improve the world. 

Lifequakes strike at the heart of what we believe brings our lives meaning and they force us to reevaluate our choices. For example, a prima ballerina who had always prized herself on her autonomy and ambition was forced to change careers after an injury. She now works as a life coach, and has found a sense of purpose in helping others. A mother who had dedicated her life to raising her kids was spurred into pursuing a career in another state when a lifequake revealed that she wasn’t actually satisfied being a stay-at-home mom. And a man abandoned a promising country music career to become a preacher.

These transformations are referred to as **shape-shifting**. Instead of trying to “recover” from a lifequake and make everything go back to “normal,” we can decide to go in another direction and completely transform the trajectory of our lives.

# Rituals help us to say goodbye to the lives we’re leaving behind.

Crises can happen to any of us. For example, anyone could get into a terrible car accident. But how people respond to a crisis like this varies widely. Some people may become furious and stuck, while others could be motivated to embrace a whole new career campaigning for road safety. An accident is a disruptor that is completely out of our control. No one would choose that particular plot twist in their life story. But we can choose what meaning we assign to it.

**The key message here is: We can’t always control disruptive events, but we do control our response to them.**

We can turn destructive events into meaningful transitions, but this requires practice. Luckily, several key tools can help us become masters at dealing with transitions. 

The first tool we need to master is acceptance. A very normal reaction to experiencing a lifequake is denial and resistance. We want to cling onto the world we know. But eventually, we need to see reality as it **is**, and not how we wish it were. Funnily enough, our bodies are often much more in tune with the world than our minds are. One woman from the Life Story Project had daily migraines which only stopped when she left her miserable job. Another person felt that something was amiss with her body long before she heard about the concept of being transgender. 

Acceptance can strike in a sudden epiphany, or a series of slow realizations. However you get there, the result is the same: accepting a situation is intrinsically empowering. It allows you to move from asking questions like **Why did this happen?** to **Where can I go from here?** And it empowers you to see possibilities which may have been invisible when you were furious and resistant to the changes.

However, acceptance isn’t about wishing away difficult emotions and pretending that everything is suddenly fine. Transitions come with many painful emotions, like fear, sadness, and shame. Practicing acceptance means allowing space for those feelings, too. You never have to get over your grief for the loss of someone you loved, or suppress your shame for mistakes you’ve made in the past. Accepting your feelings and grieving your losses is a key part of what’s called **the long goodbye**, when you’re letting go of the past and coming to terms with a big life transition. 

# All major transitions involve a messy middle, where we feel very lost.

How do we come to terms with loss? Part of saying goodbye involves creating our own rituals for commemorating the life that we no longer have.

Rituals are a vital part of marking transitions and assigning meaning to them. They help to speed up acceptance, and they allow us to integrate our pasts into the new futures awaiting us. Some rituals can involve literally marking change on our bodies. For example, an ex-Nazi chose to cover all his fascist tattoos with religious symbols to signify his conversion. Other people choose to get new piercings or a wild new hairstyle after a divorce. 

**The key message here is: Rituals help us to say goodbye to the lives we’re leaving behind. **

Communal events are an important form of ritual, providing a way to celebrate happy occasions and landmarks as well as mourn losses. Parties can mark the beginning of an important trajectory like a gender transition or pregnancy. They can also be used to signify an end point, like the completion of a PhD thesis or cancer treatment. 

Objects can play an important part in rituals, too. A former prisoner and a veteran shared their stories of keeping their dirty boots in sight at home. The boots symbolized a past they wanted to acknowledge, even though they never wanted to return there. For others, wearing a particular piece of jewelry can help them feel the presence of a place or person they love. 

Of course, rituals are especially important when it comes to grief and loss. This was something that Larry, a rabbi, discovered when his first child was stillborn. There were no established rituals of mourning within the synagogue for miscarried and stillborn children, and no way for him and his wife to publicly express their grief. So he set about creating his own rituals, and wrote a thesis advising how rabbis could support community members who were going through the same thing. 

Rituals can make visible some of our internal turmoil. They also allow us to be in connection with a broader community of people. Accepting painful emotions and creating our own rituals allows us to start accepting that our lives are changing. As we’ll discover in the next blink, the next stage involves shedding all the parts of our old lives that don’t work for us anymore.

# Our creativity can help us to create a new chapter in a transition.

Just as snakes shed their old skins to allow for shiny new growth, we have to be willing to shed parts of our old selves during a transition and allow for a period of being completely lost and confused. 

Every major religious narrative and fairy tale recognizes the value of being lost. Jesus was cast into the desert before he had a major epiphany, and Mohamed gained his wisdom on a mountaintop. The most formative experience of Red Riding Hood’s life would never have been possible if she hadn’t wandered into that forest. 

**The key message here is: All major transitions involve a messy middle, where we feel very lost.**

So if we really want to embrace transformation, we have to also embrace the **messy middle**,** **where we’ve let go of the past, but haven’t started the next chapter yet. In this phase, we’re forced to let go of outdated identities or beliefs that don’t fit us anymore. Or ingrained habits left over from parts of our lives which we no longer embrace. Shedding can leave us feeling vulnerable and raw because we feel so lost and unsure of who we are. But it also creates space for making something new.

So, how can we survive this challenging part of the transition? Some people find comfort in giving their lives a new kind of structure, for example by participating in a 12-step alcohol rehabilitation program or enrolling in a course. Others prefer to adopt a new daily practice like journaling, gardening, or walking in nature. These rituals can ground you in your daily life as you weather big changes. 

While these orderly approaches work for many people, others choose to explore more freely. A quintessential way of exploring loss is to literally start wandering through the world on adventurous travels. Some people see a period of uncertainty as an opportunity to test their own boundaries by experimenting with drugs, dating different kinds of people, or going to sex parties. These kinds of **structured play** can become an important part of the transitional process. 

The messy middle will leave you feeling completely at sea; everything that moored you to your identity disappears. On the other side of this difficult period, though, lies a new beginning. 

# We need to create new life stories that integrate our transitions.

When Henri Matisse was diagnosed with colon cancer and had to undergo grueling surgeries, it seemed to signal the end of his artistic career. He could no longer stand up, never mind hold a paintbrush. While the health crisis did in fact end his painting career, it also opened a whole new chapter in his creative life: while lying in bed he started making the remarkable bright paper cutouts that he’s so well known for today.

Transitions involve loss, but out of the chaos comes the exciting opportunity to build something new. We must allow ourselves to be creative and experimental while exploring these new possibilities. 

**The key message here is: Our creativity can help us to create a new chapter in a transition. **

Getting in touch with your own creativity can accelerate your healing after a crisis. Zach’s story is a good example of that. When the young veteran was permanently disfigured in a shootout in Afghanistan, he wanted to end his life. That changed, though, when his mother encouraged him to learn to cook. He poured his energy into grilling the perfect piece of salmon, and making fluffy plates of pancakes. He also started writing poems, and painting, channeling his frustration into wild splatters on the canvas. Zach’s flurry of creativity helped him to process some of the trauma he’d experienced during the war and start to forge a new identity for himself that wasn’t tied to being a soldier.

Creativity through writing is one of the most important tools we have in a transition. The act of writing turbo-charges the process of creating a new narrative, and allows people to feel a much greater sense of control over the past. In an experiment, psychologist James Pennebaker divided a group of people who had recently been laid off into two halves. He asked one half to write about the experience, while the other half didn’t write at all. Three months later, 27 percent of the people who had written about their experiences had found a new job, in contrast to 5 percent of those who didn’t write. Putting their stories down on paper not only allowed them to process their feelings, but it also allowed them to take actions that led to finding a new job. Whether we’re cooking, painting, writing, or salsa dancing, creative expression is one of our greatest lifelines in the wake of a lifequake. 

# We need to create new life stories that integrate our transitions.

By the end of his life, Bruce’s father had written 150 stories about his past, which he painstakingly pasted into a book, along with clippings and photographs. While once he’d been so desperate that he’d attempted to kill himself, the sheer act of writing his story gave him the sense of agency that his illness had denied him. 

During the Life Story Project, Bruce heard hundreds of stories about how people’s lives had changed. He realized that, like his father, the way people spoke about their experiences had a big impact on how they handled their transitions.

**The key message here is: We need to create new life stories that integrate our transitions. **

People who spoke about transitions as affecting their life for the worse – so-called **contamination narratives** – were also more depressed and stuck. Those who described transitions as being hard, but ultimately leading to a good outcome, so-called **redemption narratives **– felt more empowered and positive. While we don’t have control over everything that happens to us, we do have control over the stories we tell ourselves about those events, and the part we played in them. 

Creating new stories is very important, but even more important is having the chance to share them.

When our lives are in turmoil, we can feel lonely and isolated. We know how hard it is to reply to a simple question like **What do you do?** when we’re embroiled in a demoralizing job hunt. But sharing our experiences has proven benefits for our well-being and sense of personal resilience. 

Steven shared his story about escaping from the cult known as the Moonies. Once he finally escaped, he was so ashamed of how he’d behaved that he never wanted to talk about it again. But then he realized that he could help other people escape similar situations by sharing his experiences. So, Steven started speaking to large audiences and members of congress about how he’d been brainwashed and then escaped. Later, he even founded an organization assisting other cult members. In telling his story he was able to discover a new life purpose. 

When sharing your story, it’s a good idea to restrict your audience to close friends and trusted confidants. Once you’ve gotten used to sharing with those close to you, you might feel motivated to connect with a larger audience, as Steven did. Remember that your story is dynamic; you can rewrite it whenever you need to. And you can use it to help you through any of life’s changes.

# Final summary

The key message in these blinks:

**We’ve all grown up believing that our lives will progress along a neat linear path, but that is simply not true. In fact, our relationships, careers, and belief systems will undergo massive changes during our lives. To handle these transitions gracefully, we need to be prepared for them. Instead of trying to cling to the past, we need to be willing to create new narratives for our lives. We can all become masters of change if we learn to harness our natural resilience and creativity. **

Actionable advice:

**Pay attention to small wins.**

When you’re experiencing a major life transition, your mind will be full of big questions like **Who am I? **or **Where is my life going? **While those questions are important, you also need to stay grounded in the present. One of the best ways to do that is to pay attention to small daily wins. Are you able to pay your cable bill after being in financial straits? Does your newfound sobriety mean that you can drive your children to school again? These seemingly mundane changes can give you great comfort as you weather a big transition.
