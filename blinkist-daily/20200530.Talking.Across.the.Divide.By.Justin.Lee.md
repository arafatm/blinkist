 (2018) offers a useful guide on how to engage in constructive dialogues with people who hold opposing ideas or beliefs. By using these tools, you can avoid unhelpful arguments and conduct meaningful conversations that allow both sides to become better informed – and perhaps even come to a common understanding.


# What’s in it for me? Learn some valuable tools on how to discuss divisive topics and change minds.

These days, it’s hard not to feel like people are getting more and more extreme in their attitudes, and less and less tolerant to opposing views.

Our moderate temperaments have all but vanished, and we are no longer willing to compromise for the greater good. Naturally, this puts a strain on relationships. But it also makes it difficult for organizations – the US government included – to function properly.

But there **is** a valuable tool for those of us who refuse to give up on progress, facts and objective truths. It’s called **strategic dialogue**, and it’s something that author Justin Lee has been fine tuning for the past twenty years.

Lee has used strategic dialogue to bring together the Christian and LGBT community, and help many conservative parents to become more accepting toward their LGBT kids. If strategic dialogue can help bridge these divides, it can likely also help you to mend the strained relationships in your life.

In these blinks you’ll find out

- why attitudes have gotten more extreme recently;
- why arguing gets us nowhere; and
- which five barriers get in the way of seeing eye-to-eye.

# These days many of us live in an echo chamber, which leads to group polarization.

To say that we live in polarizing times would be putting it mildly. Everyday it seems like there’s a new divisive issue for people to either passionately defend or denounce. The political climate in many parts of the world has become fraught with tension and extremism.

Given the circumstances, there’s a good chance that you have friends or family that reside on the other side of the fence – probably on several issues. Naturally, this can make family gatherings, or even a casual email exchange, fraught with potential landmines. It begs the question, how did we get here?

**The key message here is: These days many of us live in an echo chamber, which leads to group polarization.**

It’s natural for us to gravitate toward those who share a similar worldview. But in the age of the internet, this natural tendency has become problematic. In the virtual world, it’s all too easy to unfollow or block anyone who has a different opinion than you. As a result, you can quickly end up in your own online **echo chamber**, surrounded by people who are all spouting the same opinions.

Further compounding this problem are the algorithms that are crunching data at places like Google and Facebook. You may not realize it, but the results of your Google searches are automatically tailored to your location and browsing history. Likewise, what you see in your Facebook timeline is the result of algorithms that take into account your history of clicks and likes.

In other words, Google and Facebook give you content that’s similar to what you or others in your area have already shown an interest in – thereby limiting your exposure to new or different ideas. Two people in different locations could do a Google search for “climate change proof,” and one could get links to legitimate scientific data, while the other gets steered toward sites sponsored by oil companies that aim to minimize that data.

These online echo chambers can also explain our decline towards extremism. Research has consistently shown that when a group of people with like-minded opinions get together, those opinions tend to become more extreme. This effect is known as **group polarization**. And with people now congregating **en masse **in online echo chambers, it’s hardly surprising that over the past twenty years, people have become increasingly entrenched in more and more extreme positions.

# 

**“A single outside voice can be incredibly powerful in countering the effects of an echo chamber.”**

# Bridge gaps and mend fences by using strategic dialogue.

Despite the recent rise in extremist views, there are some signs of hope out there.

In 1951, Polish-American psychologist Solomon Asch conducted an influential study. This study showed how a single person was likely to agree with a unified group, even if what was being agreed upon was obviously wrong – such as two lines on a chalkboard being the same length when they clearly weren’t. However, Asch’s study also showed that if just one other person from that group disagreed, this would significantly reduce the chances of the original subject succumbing to peer pressure.

This is where you come in. You can be that one voice, breaking the barrier of the echo chamber, and providing a powerful dose of reason and healthy dissent. All you need is the right tool.

**The key message here is: Bridge gaps and mend fences by using strategic dialogue.**

More often than not, when someone tries to convince a person that they’re wrong, an argument ensues. But arguments don’t get us very far. In fact, an argument is likely to result in the person doubling down on their opinion. So, what we need is a tool that avoids arguments. This is precisely what **strategic dialogue** offers.

Now, the word “dialogue” may not sound all that exciting or effective, but it is essential to getting someone to open up to an opposing idea. When you get into an argument or debate, neither side is really listening to each other. You’re just waiting for your opportunity to say what you want to say.

Strategic dialogue, on the other hand, is all about encouraging listening, and making sure each side feels like they’re being heard and understood.

Think about it, you don’t like it when someone just talks **at** you without showing any interest in why you believe what you believe, right? This is exactly why we need strategic dialogue. It takes into account all the elements that are required to create the kind of receptive, open-minded environment that leads to real communication.

If you’re going to bring together two opposing sides, this is the kind of environment you need to create. And in the following blinks, we’ll learn exactly how to do that.

# 

**“...the more important it is to change someone’s mind, the more critical the listening step becomes.”**

# The first steps to successful strategic dialogue are preparation and listening.

Everyone is moved by a passionate speech. Or are they?

If you want to convince someone to join your cause, you may be inclined to have them sit down and listen to a speech. But unfortunately, things aren’t that simple. For the most part, speeches are given to crowds of people who’ve already been converted to the cause, and the outcome is that they just become even more devout followers.

When you’re dealing with someone who is in firm opposition to your cause, the first thing you need to do is get them open to the basic idea of listening to you. And in order to do that, you have to show that **you’re** also willing to listen to **them**. This is how you set up your strategic dialogue.

**The key message here is: The first steps to successful strategic dialogue are preparation and listening.**

Strategic dialogue isn’t just a matter of talking. As the name suggests, there’s strategy involved. And this is why **preparation** is its first phase.

One of the best ways to prepare is to **listen** to what the other side has to say. This includes listening to what their concerns are and why they believe the things they do. Consider your first step to be all about information-gathering. Show patience. Reach out to more than one person. If you want someone else to hear your side of the story, you have to be reciprocal and show that you’re open to hearing their side.

Now, this can be extremely difficult. In many situations, whether it’s regarding religion, LGBT rights, reproduction rights or politics, both sides can feel passionate about their beliefs. As a result, being patient and listening to someone say the opposite of what you believe can be a real emotionally exhausting test.

You may even feel that listening is in some way validating their opinions. But this isn’t the case. You’re simply making the effort to understand where the other side is coming from, and this is a strategy that will pay off for you in the end.

An effective way to get a dialogue started, and to change someone’s mind, is to prove that you’ve been listening by repeating back what someone else has said. People want to feel heard. And by repeating someone’s story back to them, you’re giving them that experience.

It may sound simple, but when you hear your own story spoken aloud by someone else, it’s a powerful moment that will make you more willing to hear what else the person has to say.

# There are five barriers that can stand in the way of a successful dialogue, and the first is ego protection.

So you’ve listened. You’ve prepared. You understand, as best you can, why someone feels so passionately about an issue. Maybe they’ve been raised by their parents to see things a certain way. Or maybe they’re just misinformed! Whatever the case may be, it’s now time to start the dialogue and give your side of the story.

But beware. There are certain things that are guaranteed to foil your plan. These are known as the five barriers to changing someone's mind. The first has to do with the ego.

**The key message here is: There are five barriers that can stand in the way of a successful dialogue, and the first is ego protection.**

When you think of “ego,” it doesn’t have to be about self-assurance or someone being egomaniacal. In this case, ego represents our sense of self, our pride and who we are as an individual – which is why it’s something that we will fiercely protect.

Simply put, people don’t want to be seen as foolish. So when you confront someone by saying their beliefs are wrong, their defenses will immediately go up. But there are ways around this protective barrier.

Everyone is a complex hero in their own story, even people who believe the world is flat. So it’s up to you to reflect this by also crafting a story as part of your strategic dialogue. If you paint the other person as a dumb villain, you’re not going to get far. Those defenses are going to stay firmly up. But if you listen to their story, understand their motivations and then integrate that narrative into your own story, you’ll be far more convincing.

Telling a story really is one of the best ways to get your point across and change minds. Just pay attention that your narrative avoids casting the other side in a harshly negative light. Cast them as the protagonist. Repeat their story back to them – which shows that you’ve been listening – and then explain how it is understandable that someone in their position could end up with the opinion they have. This isn’t the same as you offering an excuse, it’s just an explanation.

The author has put this to use in his many years trying to bridge the gap between Christians and the LGBT community. He understands why people who grew up in a conservative Christian household can be led to believe that homosexuality is wrong. He doesn’t excuse anyone’s homophobia, but he gets people into a dialogue by putting their beliefs into an understandable narrative.

# Two more barriers to successful dialogue are team loyalty and comfort.

When someone fervently believes in an irrational idea, they’re often not alone. Chances are, there’s a whole group of people out there believing the same thing, supporting one another, and keeping the bad idea alive.

This is often a problem, because whenever a person becomes faithful to a group, it can be difficult to get that person to go against the group’s doctrine. It will be up to you to break through this **team** **loyalty**, without scaring them away.

**The key message here is: Two more barriers to successful dialogue are team loyalty and comfort.**

The key to clearing team loyalties is, once again, listening. So find out what draws people to the group in question. But more specifically, find out what drew the person you’re in dialogue with to the group. This will emphasize the distinction between their group identity and their individual identity. Likewise, be sure to talk about **your** individual experiences, and open yourself up to questions the other side may have about **your** group.

It’s important to get personal because people who want to be accepted in a group still want to be seen as individuals. Exploiting our urge for individualism is an effective way to counter the barrier of team loyalty. 

You can both get off on the right foot by entering the dialogue not as representatives of any groups, but rather as Alice and Carol, or Ted and Bob or whatever the case may be. By emphasizing your personal narratives, you’ll often find the limitations of group mentality melt away.

No matter who you’re talking to, getting someone to change their mind is a big ask because it’s uncomfortable. It’s much easier for someone to keep doing or thinking the same thing. In fact, there’s a term for this – the **status quo bias** – and it’s why **comfort** is the third barrier to successful dialogue.

The effective strategy here is to carefully raise a new discomfort that the other side hasn’t thought of before. For example, a lot of people still believe the misconception that being gay is a choice. But this belief becomes uncomfortable once they’re made aware of just how much loneliness, depression and uncertainty gay people around the world feel. Why would someone choose to go through this? 

It may be an obvious question to you, but you’d be surprised how effective this uncomfortable bit of logic works in getting people to see things from a new perspective.

# The fourth barrier to successful dialogue – misinformation – can be a difficult one to overcome.

Did you know that Pepsi was considered an un-Christian brand? Oddly enough, this bit of misinformation stems from an incident that didn’t even involve Pepsi. Rather, it started when Dr. Pepper released cans of soda, in the wake of 9/11, that carried the message “One Nation… Indivisible.”

Some religious folks believed that the cans were deliberately skipping the words “Under God” and vowed never to buy a Dr. Pepper again. But somewhere along the way, there was the mistaken belief that Dr. Pepper was owned by Pepsi, which it never was. So the ban on Dr. Pepper extended to Pepsi for no good reason.

In spite of all of this, you can still come across people who believe this misguided anti-Christian conspiracy theory. Which brings us to our next barrier.

**The key message here is: The fourth barrier to successful dialogue – misinformation – can be a difficult one to overcome.**

If you find yourself disagreeing with someone who’s been misinformed, you should know that misinformation comes in different forms. It could be that someone has been purposefully misled, or it could be that they’ve misinterpreted real news. This is something that you need to figure out through talking, listening and gathering information.

Generally speaking, purposeful misinformation is easier to fight than a disagreement about interpretation. That’s because having cold hard facts on your side can go a long way to convincing someone they need to reassess their beliefs.

Of course, even when faced with factual information, people can sometimes refuse to accept that their beliefs are wrong. You can reduce the likelihood of this happening by being strategic with how you reveal your facts. But you really want to avoid sounding condescending. As we mentioned before, if you make someone feel foolish – or otherwise wound their ego – there’s little chance you’re going to win them over to your side.

A better method is to explain your own experience of how you uncovered the misinformation and found the truth. When you do this, you can explain how you too were surprised and how it changed your understanding of things. This will open the door for the misinformed person to do the same thing – without feeling foolish.

There’s an old saying in advertising that people need to be exposed to a message seven times before it really sinks in. There may be some truth to this when it comes to changing a long-held belief. So if you fail to win someone over the first time, don’t give up hope!

# The fifth barrier to successful dialogue is worldview protection, which may require multiple steps to overcome.

Imagine being told that a belief you’ve held your entire life is wrong. Now, imagine what that means for everything you’ve built on top of that belief. Starts to sound pretty scary, doesn’t it?

The problem with changing long-held beliefs is that they’re likely connected to other beliefs. In fact, they’re so crucial to a person that they inform their entire **worldview.**

Once a long-held belief goes tumbling down, it can soon feel like everything has gone topsy-turvy. It’s no surprise then that people will resist any idea that challenges such beliefs.

**The key message here is: The fifth barrier to successful dialogue is worldview protection, which may require multiple steps to overcome.**

Let’s say your Uncle Earl disagrees with the idea of gay marriage and points to the Bible as justification. You could respond by saying that the Bible has been translated and interpreted so many times, for thousands of years, that it shouldn’t be taken literally. But you shouldn’t.

Sure, it may seem like a valid statement, but using it will likely cost you the argument. By shifting the focus from gay marriage to the Bible, you’ve moved it into worldview territory. So rather than challenging one belief, you’re challenging many more – and all at once. To put it in different terms, you went from dealing with a troublesome branch to trying to uproot an entire tree. It’s better to stick with the branch.

Oftentimes, a successful strategic dialogue isn’t about getting everything you want. It’s about making steps in the right direction. That’s why the final stage of strategic dialogue is called **next steps**.

When you’re engaged in a strategic dialogue, it’s helpful to know two things: a person’s **position**, or what they want, and their **interest**, or why they want it. It’s also good form to know your own position and interest as well. This way, at the end of the dialogue, if it’s clear that neither party will reach their full position, you can at least try to find an outcome that gets both of you closer to your interest.

The author calls this “making the ask,” which is essentially suggesting a first step in the right direction – one that would result in the other side adjusting, and perhaps even broadening, their worldview.

Expecting someone to completely uproot their worldview is unrealistic, but proposing a step in the right direction has the potential to lead a person down a life-changing path.

# Final summary

The key message in these blinks:

**Reaching across the divide to change someone’s mind on an important subject is challenging. But with the tool of strategic dialogue, it is possible. Strategic dialogue starts with preparation, which includes asking questions, listening to people from the other side, and learning about why they feel so strongly about their position. When preparing your dialogue, keep in mind the five barriers to success: ego protection, team loyalty, comfort, misinformation, and worldview protection. Many of these barriers can be avoided by strategically crafting a narrative that makes the person on the other side of the dialogue the protagonist. So try to incorporate their story, avoid making them look foolish and avoid condescension. You can then encourage them to use small steps that will broaden their worldview.**

Actionable advice:

**Take notes.**

Don’t forget to bring paper and pen to your dialogue. This can serve two purposes. First, since nobody’s perfect, there will likely be moments when you realize a mistake was made. With your pen and paper at hand, you can easily make a note of this and avoid making the same mistake next time. 

Second, having pen and paper is a good way not to lose your cool. There’s a good chance that the other side may at some point say something infuriating. But strategic dialogue isn’t about interrupting, yelling or starting an argument. So instead, when you feel your temperature rising, write down your angry thoughts and work on the words you would use to address this point when you’re in a calmer place.
