# What’s in it for me? A rundown of remote work strategies.

Working from home sounds like a dream. There’s no commute, you’ve got snacks at hand, and you don’t have to face any chatty colleagues. But all that freedom comes with additional responsibility. Some even struggle to remain productive.

Luckily, **The New Corner Office** is here to help. To assemble this practical guide to remote work, time management expert Laura Vanderkam drew on her two decades’ experience researching professional success, as well as countless interviews with managers, employees, and freelancers around the world. 

The result? A simple set of tried-and-tested strategies for remaining productive, creative, and happy while working remotely. The sensible recommendations found in this book-in-blinks will help you stay on task, stick to your routines, and accomplish your goals – all without succumbing to cabin fever. 

In these blinks, you’ll learn

- what puppies can teach us about work;
- how to make a digital happy hour; and
- why you should always pick a room with a view.

# When working from home, think in terms of tasks, not time.

It’s no secret that puppies love to play. But can they also teach us about work? For Meredith Schwartz, CEO of the wedding planning company Here Comes the Guide, the answer was a resounding yes.

When Schwartz got her first puppy, she decided to spend a few weeks working from home as the new pet settled in. At first, she worried that she wouldn’t be productive while away from the office. However, she found the opposite to be true. She got more done. 

In fact, the experiment was such a success that she slowly shifted her entire company to remote work. Now, her team works from home. So how do they stay effective? Well, they focus on completing tasks, not putting in hours.

**The key message here is: When working from home, think in terms of tasks, not time.**

The traditional workday asks us to toil from nine to five, 40 hours a week. Often, however, those hours don’t correlate with any outcomes. After all, we’ve all spent days sitting at a desk doing nothing, merely because it’s expected. Manage your day more effectively by ditching the time sheets and instead evaluating your performance based on what you actually do. 

A good way to reorient your work around productivity, not time, is to draw up a list of tasks for each week. Every Friday, take a moment to write down what you would like to get done the following week. This should include discrete duties that can be done in a day as well as milestones to meet on longer-term projects. If you manage employees, you can create accountability by having your workers submit their lists to you each week as well.

Once you have your agenda, forget about hours. Each day, just focus on crossing items off the list. Some days, you’ll meet your goal early. Don’t fret – you can always work on tomorrow’s tasks. But remember, there’s nothing wrong with quitting at noon if you’re getting everything done. When working from home, you’re in charge of your schedule, and knowing when to stop is just as important as knowing when to start.

At the end of each day, complement your to-do list with a “to-done” list. This is a record of everything you accomplished each day, whether it was on your original agenda or not. Keeping tabs on your progress helps refine your time management for the next week.

“**As a task is set and accomplished, the power of progress kicks in. Do this day after day, and – no matter how many hours people are working – they soon feel unstoppable**.” 

# Find a daily schedule that resonates with your work.

Let’s take a trip to a monastery. Here, devout monks diligently go about their days in calm harmony. They rise at dawn for lauds, keep occupied with chores in the afternoon, and wind down in the evening with vespers. And they do it all without their abbott micromanaging the process.

Now, you don’t need to take holy vows to have such focus and discipline. However, as these monks show, there’s certainly a virtue in keeping your schedule stable and predictable. While remote work lets us abandon the rigid schedule of the office, it’s still smart to structure your day with the right rhythm**.**

**The key message here is: Find a daily schedule that resonates with your work.**

When you work from home, you often have the freedom to fill your days as you see fit. This wide-open schedule is nice, but without some form of organization, it can lead to stress and distraction. You’ll end up wasting time and energy deciding what to do and when to do it. Avoid this pitfall by planning a rough template for how to approach your working hours.

First, create a ritual to replace your commute. While rush-hour traffic is dreadful, the routine of traveling to and from the office clearly demarcates the boundaries of the work day. Signify your own transition in and out of a professional mind-set with simple practices. Maybe start the day with a short walk or mindful meditation, and end the day with a closing activity like journaling or picking up the kids from school.

Next, divide your working hours into a rough schedule. Track your energy levels and find what time of the day you feel most alert. It may be two hours in the morning, or a certain stretch of the afternoon. Dedicate that period to accomplishing your most pressing tasks. You’ll find concentrating your attention on specific blocks of time keeps you focused and boosts productivity.

Don’t forget to schedule breaks as well. Even the most dedicated workers start slipping without a few moments to rest the mind. Experiment until you find a balance that works. For some people, it helps to balance 25 minutes of work with a five-minute rest. Others feel more comfortable with a ratio of 45 minutes to 15 minutes.

Of course, if you’re part of an organization, your daily rhythm will have to harmonize with your colleagues' tempos, too. We’ll take a look at managing these relationships in the next blink. 

# You can still foster close relationships while working remotely.

Have a listen to the **Best of Both Worlds** podcast. The hosts, Sarah and Laura, banter, quip, and chat like old friends. The rapport is so warm and fluid you’d never guess that the two people on the mics are hardly ever in the same room. In reality, they’ve only met in person a few times.

Still, even separated by thousands of miles, the hosts have built a strong friendship through consistent virtual communication. Between recording sessions, the pair are constantly texting, emailing, and having chummy video check-ins.

So, while working from home can seem isolating, it doesn’t have to be. With a little bit of effort and planning, even a remote workforce can remain a close and collaborative community.

**The key message here is: You can still foster close relationships while working remotely.**

Skeptics of remote work often claim the lack of face-to-face interaction hampers the robust personal relationships needed for a company to succeed. And while it’s true that sharing a physical space makes socializing easier, we now have plenty of tools to re-create the old office watercooler in the virtual world. 

One way to cultivate personal connections from afar is to set aside certain times for more casual conversation. For instance, if you have a weekly video call with a remote team, dedicate the first ten minutes to chit-chat. Start with a couple of jokes or maybe a few open-ended personal questions to get everyone riffing about topics other than work.

You can even re-create typical team-building activities in the digital world. Try scheduling a video-chat cocktail hour or virtual dinner party so colleagues can have a chance to talk in a more informal setting. Don’t be afraid to get creative. Erin Ruane, a marketing executive at Homes.com, invites employees to give guided tours of their homes and introduce their children and pets on camera.

Even with all this technology, there’s still something special about personal contact. If possible, try to convene your remote workforce once or twice a year for in-person meetings. They don’t have to be elaborate, either. Sure, it would be nice to fly the whole team out to Fiji for a week-long retreat, but even a few hours at a local conference center or bar can do a lot to build closer working relationships. 

Overall, the most important thing is to foster an atmosphere of openness. You want to create a workplace where reaching out for casual conversation is a regular part of your team’s repertoire.

# Achieve your potential by always seeking new challenges. 

When you’re working for a traditional company downtown, it’s easy to spot the superstar professionals. Usually, they’ve got a big corner office on the top floor and a personal secretary, and they saunter around in expensive designer suits.

When you work from home, professional success may look completely different. That C-suite office could be a corner of your living room, and that power suit might just be a pair of sweatpants. Without the typical status symbols guiding your rise, the outlines of an ambitious career path are a bit more ambiguous.

Still, while the remote work lifestyle doesn’t require that you abandon your high aspirations, you may need to adopt some new strategies to keep your eyes on the prize.

**The key message here is: Achieve your potential by always seeking new challenges. **

When working from home, it’s easy to forget the world outside your four walls. So, to stay on the right track and give yourself guidance, it’s particularly important to check in regularly with your goals and desires. To do this, career coach Caroline Ceniza-Levine recommends making a “List of 100 Dreams.” 

This is a simple list of things you want to do. When making it, don’t limit yourself. These items should include anything that piques your interest, whether personal or professional. Ideally, you’ll end up listing both specific, short-term goals, like finding a mentor, and broader, long-term goals, like becoming your own boss. Once you’ve made the inventory, you can use it to guide your actions. 

One way to help narrow down exactly what you want from life is to imagine your ideal working week. Ask yourself, “If everything were going perfectly, how would I spend my time?” Maybe you want to start each day with a workout and devote the evening to friends and family. With these concrete goals, you’ll have a target to reach for when organizing your professional path. 

Finally, always be open to unexpected opportunities. Don’t let an overly strict remote-work routine limit your imagination. If you have an unconventional idea, give it a shot and see what happens. Maybe that means taking on a project slightly outside your field of expertise or meeting with an unconventional client. As long as the effort doesn’t cut into your essential tasks, it may have payoffs you couldn’t even imagine.

“**You are the architect of your career – your means for impacting the world – whether you’re part of an organization or running your own.**”

# Optimize your working experience by creating a comfortable environment.

By now, you might suspect that remote workers are a little more satisfied with their setup than their commuting counterparts. But just how much happier are people who work from home? As it turns out, there are stats on that.

One survey from TINYpulse, a firm that studies employee engagement, found that remote workers score an average of 8.1 on a ten-point happiness scale. Other workers average closer to 7.5. Moreover, other studies show remote workers take fewer sick days and can actually put in more hours a week without burning out. 

Clearly, there are advantages to working at home. But adapting to this style of work doesn’t always come naturally. If you’re new to remote work, you may need some tips and tricks to get the most out of your home office.

**The key message here is: Optimize your working experience by creating a comfortable environment.**

Unless you’ve always worked from home, your domestic space may not be equipped like a professional office. It may sound superficial, but having the right furniture and amenities can do a lot to boost your productivity. After all, curling up on the couch with your computer may be cozy, but after a while, you will find yourself nodding off – or, worse, dealing with back pain and eye strain.

Save your spine by investing in an appropriate workspace. A solid desk, ergonomic office chair, and proper lighting will help you remain comfortable as you put in eight hours a day. And this doesn’t mean your home office has to be cold or sterile. Take the time to make your workspace appealing with personal touches like decorations and plenty of plants. A nice view always helps, too. So, if you can, try setting up near a window. 

You can further enhance your remote work experience by including space for staying active. You don’t need to go all-in on a home gym, but picking up a few items like resistance bands, dumbbells, or a yoga mat makes it easy to integrate some exercise into your days. With this gear nearby, you can fit a short workout into your regularly scheduled breaks. This will help you stay healthy and eliminate that excess energy that keeps you from focusing.

No home office is perfect for everyone. But through trial and error, you’ll discover the right mix of routines and equipment for you. Within a couple of weeks, you’ll never miss the office again.

# Final summary

The key message in these blinks:

**While some employers are still skeptical about employees working from home, it actually offers ample advantages. By adopting simple strategies like finding a daily rhythm and checking in with colleagues regularly, it’s possible to stay productive, connected, and ambitious while working remotely. If you invest in proper office equipment and orient your days around tasks, not time, you’ll make remote work make sense for you and your company.**

Actionable advice:

**Go on little adventures.**

Working from home does have one downside: days tend to have less variety. Shake up your schedule by consciously adding a dose of excitement with small adventures. A few times a week, try something new. It could be as simple as cooking a new recipe or taking a walk around an unexplored neighborhood. The novelty will help keep life a little more interesting.
