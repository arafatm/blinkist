(2019) is a guide to business and personal success for those who march to their own beat. This bold manifesto asks you avoid conformity and instead embrace the qualities that set you apart.


# What’s in it for me? A toast to being different.

So many business guides value conformity over creativity. Their rules and strict prescriptions make it seem like there’s only one road to success. But there is another way. 

These blinks argue that the best way forward is to see virtues where others only see vices. Are you ambitious, obsessed, and maybe a little bit weird? Those individual quirks or so-called imperfections are actually your most valuable asset. 

Based on the experiences of two audacious entrepreneurs, Sunny Bonnell and Ashleigh Hansberger, this guide shows why sticking to the straight and narrow over your own idiosyncratic identity is a dead end. With real-world examples and entertaining anecdotes, these blinks are the ideal companion for anyone who wants to rise to the top without losing their personal charm. 

Once you’re convinced of this counterintuitive approach, discover which vice is actually your primary virtue with the Rare Breed quiz: rarebreedbook.com/quiz/.

In these blinks, you’ll learn 

- why 10,000 hours of practice isn’t enough;
- how red shoes make you stand out; and
- why you should never punt.

# Rebelliously defying norms can open new paths to success.

It’s fourth down and the Pulaski Academy Bruins need to move the ball ten yards upfield or turn it over to the other team. Any other high school football team would simply give up and punt the ball. After all, convention states that this is the smart move. 

But, the Bruins don’t follow conventional wisdom. In 2009, their coach, Kevin Kelley, looked at three years’ worth of game statistics and made a decision: his team would never punt, ever. 

And it worked. The unusual strategy caught other teams off guard, and the Bruins racked up win after win. By 2018, the team had an overwhelmingly positive record, including seven state championships. 

**The key message here is: Rebelliously defying norms can open new paths to success.**

Our society encourages conformity through strict social norms. It enforces rigid policies and rewards proper etiquette. Starting from a very young age, we’re encouraged to do as we’re told or we’ll suffer the consequences. Even in a modern workplace, rules rule. One study from the **Harvard Business Review** found that fewer than 10 percent of companies actually encourage workers to break the mold.

However, rebelling against conventions can be an asset when done strategically. Take the television show **Girls.** This provocative series told the story of young women in New York City, but it avoided all the classic tropes. Instead of showing their lives as glamorous, it focused on their mistakes and minor humiliations. And the show was a hit! People loved the unconventional approach and unique characters.

Still, it’s no good to break rules for no reason. The key to rebelling is thinking strategically. First, know exactly what rules you want to break and why you want to break them. Then, think through what you’re going to do differently and what the consequences will be. This way, you’re not just blindly smashing norms, but creating your own conventions.

For instance, entrepreneur Matt Scanlan wanted to disrupt the exploitative Mongolian wool industry. The old industry model used dozens of middlemen to get Mongolian wool to market. It was inefficient and expensive. 

Scanlan came in with a better plan. He broke the old mold and set up a new system to pay herders directly. As a result, his company, Naadam, can now offer the finest cashmere at a low cost, and Mongolia’s herders earn up to 50 percent more.

Obviously, breaking the rules takes a little bit of audacity. In the next blink, we’ll see how that ambitious spirit is also a rich resource. 

# Realizing ambitious plans requires an audacious spirit.

In 2007, authors Sunny Bonnell and Ashleigh Hansberger were at an all-time low. They had just pitched their company, Motto, at the Count Me In start-up competition. But, instead of crushing it, they froze and forgot their lines. It was a disaster. 

They could have just given up. It was the logical thing to do. But, the two entrepreneurs weren't feeling logical. They were feeling bold. So, they stayed up all night drinking and writing. And the next day, they swallowed their pride, got back up on stage, and delivered a ferocious pitch.

The gutsy comeback worked. They won the competition, taking home a big prize and a serious lesson about not giving up.

**The key message here is: Realizing ambitious plans requires an audacious spirit. **

Oftentimes, the biggest barrier to success is our own ability to think big. When we’re conceiving plans, we become so focused on our restrictions and liabilities that we begin to curtail our vision before we start. However, dropping this conservative mindset and adopting a more courageous, spirited, and eager attitude can help you flourish like never before.

This was the case with Patrick Brown, founder of Impossible Foods. For years, people told him that making a vegetarian burger that even carnivores would love was hopeless. But, Brown was undaunted. He tried and tested dozens of recipes until he hit the right mix of proteins and pigments to make the Impossible Burger. Now, this veggie alternative is enjoyed in thousands of restaurants around the world.

One way to adopt a daring mindset is to always think in terms of what’s possible. Instead of focusing on your restraints, ask yourself, “What would I do if nothing was holding me back?” This exercise reframes your thinking. And, instead of seeing what’s obstructing you, you’re open to considering opportunities. 

Of course, following an audacious plan doesn't always work out. After all, if success was always guaranteed, you probably weren’t dreaming big enough. So, always ensure you have an “impossibility airbag.” Think of this as your personal safety net that will help you land if it all comes crashing down. Your airbag could include useful provisions like extra cash or a support network of encouraging mentors and friends to help you get back on track.

The important thing is, even if you fail, you get back out there and have the audacity to try again. We’ll delve deeper into the value of a persistent attitude in the next blink.

# To truly succeed, be obsessed with your goal.

How many hours of practice does it take to become a master? 10,000? At least, this is the number made famous by Malcolm Gladwell. However, according to the researcher Gladwell originally cites, the actual number is much, much higher.

Try 25,000. This is how many hours of dedicated practice a world-class classical musician typically invests in their craft. That’s about three hours of grueling practice a day, every day, for 20 years straight. 

Clearly, excellence isn’t something you can attain easily. No, you have to be driven enough to put your nose to the grindstone – or in a musican’s case, your fingers to the fretboard – over and over again.

**The key message here is: To truly succeed, be obsessed with your goal.**

So, what does it mean to be obsessed? Obsession means that you’re so focused on attaining your desired outcome, that you’ll keep pushing well beyond the average person’s limits. Obsession is Prince doing a three-hour sound check before each show. It’s Kobe Bryant waking up at 4 a.m. just to practice shooting before dawn. It’s Marie Curie continuing to work in her lab, even as the radiation made her sick.

The best way to foster an obsessive outlook is to find a goal that you truly love. Whether you’re trying to master an instrument, write the perfect novel, or get your start-up off the ground, you have to believe in your mission enough to sacrifice for it. If you don’t love your goal more than you love clocking out early or sleeping in, you’ll never dedicate the appropriate amount of time and effort to achieving it.

Consider Jiro Ono, the 93-year-old sushi master made famous in the documentary **Jiro Dreams of Sushi**. He’s dedicated his life to his culinary art, and anyone who wants to train with him must do so as well. In fact, Jiro’s apprentices train for 12 years so that they perfect each step of the sushi-making process. This means they spend weeks on the same task, no matter how boring it gets.

But, even obsession needs some restraint. When you dedicate yourself to a goal, don’t let the rest of your life fall apart around you. Stay healthy, keep your workspace clean, and stay in touch with friends and family. After all, an organized desk and a robust support network can make reaching your goal that much easier.

# To do well, do what you love.

It’s June, 2018. Brasserie Les Halles, a small restaurant in Lower Manhattan, is surrounded by flowers, bottles of wine, and heartfelt letters. For days, people have left these mementos to commemorate Anthony Bourdain, the recently-deceased chef and journalist.

Why did one man’s death cause such an outpouring of emotion? Because he gave so much of himself to his work. For decades, Bourdain followed his hot-blooded passion for food and travel. His love of adventurous eating was so powerful that it inspired hit shows, best-selling books, and countless fans who embarked on their own culinary adventures.

Clearly, hot-blooded passion is the secret ingredient to a successful life. So, to avoid cooking up a bland career, it’s important to find your own calling.

**The key message here is: To do well, do what you love.**

In the modern world, many people settle into careers that they can just barely tolerate. Rather than striving for jobs that satisfy the soul, we take positions that are safe and reliable. The result is a dull, dead-end existence, where we just wait for the weekend, and then spend the weekend dreading Monday. How depressing!

Luckily, there is an alternative. We can forego caution and pursue an invigorating life. This is what Sarah Marquis did. Even as a young girl, Marquis had a love for adventure. Rather than suppressing that wild side, she embraced it and dedicated her life to long-distance walking. In 2010, she walked from Siberia all the way down to Australia. This 12,500-mile trek earned her the title of **National Geographic**’s Adventurer of the Year, and a new career writing memoirs of her travels.

Not everyone knows their passion from birth. But, you can find it by saying yes to every opportunity. Don’t shy away from trying new things, even if they don’t immediately appeal to you. 

Take it from Danny Bonnell. As a young soldier, he was offered a chance to sing in a USO show. Despite being hesitant, he hopped up on stage and sang his heart out. This small act of initiative kicked off a long and successful life as a performer, a life Bonnell never previously imagined.

No matter what your passion ends up being, let the emotion it awakens within you fuel your work. Sometimes, you’ll find great joy, other times you’ll find frustration and anger. But, if you channel that energy back into your work, you’ll be able to use it to power your success.

**“When an opportunity comes, trust your passion, not your fear.”**

# Be weird and celebrate what makes you stand out.

Four generations.** **That’s how long Steve Pateman’s family company had been making traditional men’s shoes in Northamptonshire, England. However, in the late 1990s, cheap imports flooded the market, and Pateman couldn't compete with the low costs. After all, who would pay twice as much for the same, basic loafer?

Then, Pateman had a thought: Who says he has to keep making sensible shoes? He ditched the old designs and started producing flashy and glamorous boots in various sizes. The kinky footwear was a hit with performers, drag queens, and the transgender community. 

By 2000, the company was selling more shoes than ever, proving that getting ahead sometimes means walking on the wild side.

**The key message here is: Be weird and celebrate what makes you stand out. **

In a world where conformity is the norm, being weird can be a real asset. Think of successful celebrities, from Tim Burton and David Bowie to Andy Warhol and Salvador Dalí. It’s often the eccentric individuals who truly make a mark on society.

Why is strangeness such a draw? For one, embracing your quirks shows that you not only have something unique to offer, but that you’re also confident enough to stand by your curious self. A 2013 study from the **Journal of Consumer Research** called it the “Red Sneakers Effect.” They found that people who flout strict dress codes with their own personal style are often viewed as more competent and valuable.

It turns out, being weird is good business. In the overflowing consumer market, it’s important to stand out by offering products and services that can’t be found anywhere else. This was the strategy used by Prohibition Bakery. The small shop dominated New York City’s competitive confectionary scene by serving up bizarre cupcake flavors with a boozy twist. Why settle for vanilla when you could try Scotch and Cigar?

So, how do you tap into your own source of weirdness? The best approach is to think strategically. Consider what you do well, but also, what you do differently. Do you have a twisted sense of humor or memorable niche interest? If you’re upfront about your oddities, you may find others on the same wavelength. 

You could also try applying your remarkable skills and knowledge in unexpected places. You may just come up with a completely new product. Now, you just need to convince people to give it a try. We’ll talk about that in the next blink. 

# Charm an audience by capturing their imagination.

One moment, the Statue of Liberty stands tall above the Hudson Bay. Then, the lights go out. And when they turn on again, something amazing has happened. Lady Liberty is gone! Magician David Copperfield has made the famous landmark vanish. The audience gasps and cheers.

Of course, not really. This 1983 publicity stunt was simply a masterful bit of technical magic. When the lights went dark, the audience's seating rotated away from the statue, changing their view. But, thanks to Copperfield’s dramatic flair, they briefly accepted that the impossible was possible.

You see, a little hypnotic charisma goes a long way. If you put people in the right mindset, you can make their skepticism disappear. 

**The key message here is: Charm an audience by capturing their imagination.**

While our culture loves the myth of the lone genius, the truth is, no one achieves anything without the support of others. Whether you’re a salesperson hawking a new product, a start-up founder pitching to investors, or a magician pulling a rabbit from a hat, you’re not going to succeed unless the audience is on your side. 

Being persuasive isn’t actually magic, but there are a few tricks you can use to turn on the charm. When psychologists from Claremont McKenna College studied charismatic individuals, they found that they had three essential traits. One, they were expressive in their emotions. Two, they were sensitive to the moods and desires of others. And three, they could adapt their tone to resonate with their audience.

This means the art of persuasion is collaborative. When Barack Obama lit up a room with his public speaking, it wasn’t because he lectured the crowds, it was because he made each listener feel part of something bigger. Similarly, when Steve Jobs introduced a new product, he spoke in grand terms of changing the world. He made the audience feel important just for wanting to buy his wares. 

Of course, like any skill, charismatic speaking takes practice. Cultivate your own persuasive abilities by taking every chance you can to charm others. Go to job interviews, deliver talks at events, or hit up a local open mic night. 

If you’re feeling nervous, that’s normal. Just remember, your goal is to connect with your audience. Don’t just give a speech, tell a story. Lead with a good hook to capture everyone’s attention, then follow through with a confident, honest tone that lets your personality and emotion shine through.

“**We all have a story. You do. Your work does. If you’re leading or running an organization, it has a story**.” 

# Emotions, empathy, and sincerity are actually strengths.

May, 1969. The US Senate is locked in a tense budgeting debate. A few senators are encouraging harsh cost-saving measures across the board, including cuts to PBS, the country’s public television station. Only one man can save the service. Surprisingly it’s not a crafty accountant. It’s Mr. Rogers.

When the gentle host of the beloved children’s show **Mr. Roger’s Neighborhood** came to testify before the Senate, he didn’t speak of money or the economy. Instead, he spoke from the heart. He explained how public TV had the power to bring joy to viewers, young and old.

His emotional approach worked. Even the notoriously tough Senator John Pastore admitted he was moved and voted to fund the station.

**The key message here is: Emotions, empathy, and sincerity are actually strengths.**

We’re often told to think with our heads, not with our hearts, especially when it comes to the professional world. But, people aren’t cold and calculating robots. Everyone has feelings and emotions. Knowing how to understand and express these more sensitive sentiments is actually a very valuable skill. 

In fact, when psychologist Elaine Aron studied “highly sensitive people,” or individuals who feel their emotions particularly strongly, she made an interesting discovery. Highly sensitive people make for highly effective leaders. Not only are these individuals more intuitive and creative, but they are also better at understanding the needs of others. They can easily inspire those around them and smooth over disruptive conflicts.

Some of the most successful leaders are noted for their empathetic side. Howard Schultz, the CEO of Starbucks, is famous for treating business partners like family. He often writes emails to stakeholders with genuine messages, always closing with the phrase, “Onward with love.” It’s that personal touch, as much as the coffee, that keeps people coming back.

Don’t be afraid to include some of your personal life habits at the office. Be sincere and direct. You’ll be surprised by how liberating it can be to treat everyone, from clients to colleagues, as real people with real feelings. 

# Final summary

The key message in these blinks:

**Many of the personal qualities we’re taught to be harmful vices are actually helpful virtues. Weird interests, strong personalities, and bold antics all have their place. Learning to apply your unique characteristics in the right way can help you stand out, forge your own path, and connect with others in ways that following the rules just can’t deliver.**
