 (2019) explores how brands can communicate sensitively and effectively in a crisis. Author Kate Hartley explains why consumers connect so intimately with brands, and why social media is a threat to businesses. She also offers valuable advice for how to execute a crisis communication plan.


# What’s in it for me? Create a crisis communication plan to help your business weather any storm.

When we think about the word “crisis,” images of natural disasters, global recession, and terrorist attacks probably spring to mind. 

In the business world, a crisis is defined as a threat to operations that can negatively impact a brand. Examples of crises include: a significant drop in sales, the falling of a company valuation or, in more serious cases, a loss of lives. If crises aren’t handled correctly, businesses can suffer severe financial losses, and irrevocably damage their reputation. 

For today’s businesses, learning how to communicate in a time of crisis is more important than ever. Today’s consumers create deep connections with brands, and hold them to high ethical standards. They also demand complete transparency from the brands they choose to support. Organizations that understand how and why consumers behave – and the motivations that drive them – will be better equipped to communicate with them when crisis strikes.

In these blinks, we’ll take a deep dive into how consumers interact with brands. We’ll also look at how brands can manage communications with their audience in a time of crisis.

Along the way, you’ll learn:

- how consumers use social media to boycott brands;
- why good leadership is essential in a crisis; and
- the importance of empathy in crisis management.

# Consumers build close relationships with brands that are authentic and transparent.

Let’s begin with the story of an unhappy customer. 

Ashley is an environmental campaigner from Florida. A few years ago, Ashley needed to buy a new car – but it couldn’t be just **any** car. If she was going to drive at all, it could only be with a sustainable vehicle. So she opted for a Volkswagen. The company had a reputation for being environmentally friendly. What could go wrong?

Ashley was happy with her purchase until news broke of a scandal. Volkswagen had lied about the amount of carbon dioxide its vehicles released into the atmosphere. The actual number was far higher than the company had originally declared.

Ashley felt betrayed: the brand she had championed had broken her trust. So she retaliated on social media, writing posts about how let down she felt. 

**Here’s the key message: Consumers build close relationships with brands that are authentic and transparent.**

In today’s world, consumers connect with brands on an intimate level. When we like a brand, we enter into an emotional relationship with them. We give them our loyalty, and we expect their loyalty in return. 

These are called **passion brands – **ones that, for some reason or another, just **get** us. Once these brands have us hooked, we’re with them for life. If you tried persuading a Mac user to switch to a PC, for example, you probably wouldn’t be that successful. 

This is because brands are part of our social identity. They make us feel smart or fashionable, or maybe they reflect something we’re passionate about, like the environment. Think about why you bought your favorite pair of sneakers: you’re likely a fan of the brand’s ethos, and you like the feeling of being associated with a cool product. 

The problem is, brands we support can also let us down. A good example of this is Facebook – a platform many of us rely on to protect our private conversations, memories, and photos. 

In 2018, the social media giant broke the trust of its users when it shared their personal data with Cambridge Analytica – without permission. Unsurprisingly, users were outraged.** **In fact, a 2018 poll by Axios and SurveyMonkey revealed that one in five people in the UK deleted their account immediately after the scandal. 

Every brand will experience a crisis at some point– and when they do, they’ll need to know how to respond. We’ll take a look at this in the following blinks.

# Brands can trigger consumer outrage in multiple ways.

In 2015, the American novelist Harper Lee published a sequel to **To Kill a Mockingbird.** She called it **Go Set a Watchman.**

Originally, fans were thrilled. But, after reading the book, they realized one crucial difference: Lee had changed the main character and hero, Atticus Finch, from a civil rights advocate into a racist. 

Lee’s fans were distraught. Atticus had always been a symbol of the fight for civil rights. To find out that he was flawed was heartbreaking. Feeling betrayed, fans publicly condemned Lee, and even brought her mental health into question. 

Just as authors can cause uproar among their readers, so can brands with their audience.

**Here’s the key message: Brands can trigger consumer outrage in multiple ways.**

According to Daniel Karlsson and Lucas Rodriguez – researchers at Umea University in Sweden – brands create a set of values that have a deep appeal to individuals. And when they act against these values, consumers take it personally. 

That’s why, when the fans of **To Kill a Mockingbird **found out that their beloved hero was actually a racist, they felt cheated – as if something had been taken away from them.

Another way brands can trigger outrage is by messing up a widely-used service. For example, in 2018, multiple rail companies in the United Kingdom suddenly changed their timetables. As a result, services were repeatedly delayed or canceled for weeks. 

The backlash against this was huge. Unhappy commuters posted pictures on social media of overcrowded trains, and of people competing for space at busy stations. The situation made front-page news for weeks afterward. So, why did this become such a national story? 

Well, the agony of delayed transport is something everyone can identify with. Trying to get to and from work when trains are out of whack is something all commuters have experienced at some point in their lives. 

More importantly, the story itself was **appealing.** Southern Rail was clearly the bad guy, and the public were victims at the mercy of a big corporate company. PR professionals should be keenly aware that people simply love a good scandal. 

Sharing our outrage with others can be a way of sharing a form of identity – just like the brands we wear. Now, with the rise of social media, consumers have all the tools at their disposal to express their outrage about brands publicly. And they won’t back down until they’ve won. 

# Social media gives consumers a platform to take down brands.

A few years ago, the author had a nasty online experience. 

She had written a blog post about an advertisement that John Lewis, a major UK retailer, had launched in the run-up to Christmas. The ad featured a dog that had been left outside in a kennel surrounded by snow, while its owners stayed tucked up indoors.

Animal rights campaigners were outraged, and accused the retailer of glorifying the neglect of animals. Many of them took to social media and started a campaign group on Facebook. This eventually attracted enough media attention to persuade John Lewis to reshoot the ending of the ad. 

But the campaigners didn’t stop there. Soon, they began attacking anyone who was seen to be supporting the advertisement, like the author. Her blog post didn’t judge whether or not the dog should have been outside; it simply examined the power of a small group of campaigners to derail a corporate giant. 

Even so, the author was abused publicly online: her personal details were published on the campaign group, and she was sent cruel messages by numerous strangers.

**Here’s the key message: Social media gives consumers a platform to take down brands.**

In the digital age, consumers have the power to influence a brand’s behavior. In fact, many make it their mission to dethrone unwieldy brands that betray them. 

This is partially because social media makes it so easy for consumers to express outrage. When they feel angry about a brand’s behavior, they can take to Facebook or Twitter to communicate how they feel to everyone online. 

This isn’t always good news for brands: when they mess up, they’re held accountable **publicly **for their actions, and risk having their reputation permanently damaged. 

As the author explains, organizations today face an unprecedented level of scrutiny by consumers. And, they’re judged, rightly or wrongly, for every move they make. Remember Ashley and her experience with Volkswagen? She held the company to a high ethical standard and, when they turned out to be dishonest, she couldn’t just let it slide.

No business is perfect. There will be times where you’ll have to deal with consumer backlash, which is why it’s important to be prepared. In the next blinks, we’ll take a look at how brands can put together a communications plan to implement when crisis strikes. 

# The first step in planning for crisis communication is defining what a “crisis” means for your brand.

What do you consider a “crisis”? 

This is a question every organization should ask themselves. It sounds simple, but before you can put your crisis plan into action, you'll need to know that you're actually in a crisis.

**Here’s the key message: The first step in planning for crisis communication is defining what a “crisis” means for your brand.**

According to Jonathan Hemus, a crisis management specialist, one definition of a crisis for a company is something that makes you unable to run your **core business.**

For example, in the UK in 2018, KFC – a fast-food chain that serves fried chicken – ran out of chicken… Yes, really. 

Some might argue that this wasn’t a crisis at all. Sure, some customers may have had to go elsewhere, but no one got hurt. However, if your core business is based on selling chicken, and you’re unable to get your hands on it, then this can certainly be called a crisis.

So, how can you work out if your company is in crisis?

Well, one way is to work out the difference between an issue and a full-blown crisis. By reversing Hemus’ definition, we can assume that issues are things that don’t** **affect your company’s ability to function; they’re just things you have to manage as part of your day-to-day business.

For example, some companies say that they are in “a permanent state of crisis,” where they are constantly having to solve problems. But, what they actually mean is that they’re managing** issues** that are so common, they’ve become routine. These issues might be serious, but they don’t stop the business functioning altogether.

Of course, a crisis will mean different things to different organizations. That’s why it’s important to come up with your own set of criteria that can help you define when you’re in a crisis. 

Your business’s crisis criteria might include an injury, a threat to public safety, or an incident that could cause financial damage or affect the company’s reputation. Other criteria might be more closely linked with your company’s values. For example, if a brand of vegan cheese is found to have animal products in it, this is probably more of a crisis than an issue. 

So, next time you approach a potential crisis, take a minute to think. If there is no public emergency, and no risk to your reputation or finances, then you’re unlikely to be facing a real catastrophe.

# Your brand’s survival depends on having a plan for when a crisis strikes.

In today’s world, organizations can’t afford to disregard the dangers of digital threats. 

For example, in May 2017, the UK’s National Health Service (NHS) fell victim to a major cybersecurity incident. The organization’s IT system – which is used by hospitals and medical clinics across the country – was hacked. And the perpetrators demanded money to restore the system. 

On the first day of the crisis, four NHS organizations fell victim to the attack. A week later, over 600 had been affected. 

According to a report by the National Audit Office, the crisis could have been prevented if the NHS were sufficiently prepared. Had they maintained their IT systems and updated their security software, the system wouldn’t have been as vulnerable to cyberattacks. 

**Here’s the key message: Your brand’s survival depends on having a plan for when a crisis strikes.**

It’s impossible to predict when and where a crisis will occur, but businesses must be prepared. So, let’s dive into how you can do this.

The first step to creating a **pre-crisis plan** is to select your crisis team. This should include representatives from all business departments, including HR, legal, compliance and risk, and technology. You should also include teams from PR and marketing, who will be responsible for communicating the details of the crisis to your external audience.

Make sure you’re absolutely clear what everyone’s roles are. You’ll need to know who is authorized to activate a crisis plan, and who is ultimately responsible for decision-making. 

Secondly, within your team, try to come up with every possible scenario you can think of that could negatively impact the reputation of your company. Categorize these scenarios first by type, and then by level of threat. 

For example, a data breach that impacts a few people, and does not put any financial information at risk could be Stage 1: a low level of threat. On the other hand, a breach that exposes the financial data of thousands of customers may be classified as Stage 4: a high level of threat. 

Lastly, agree on the appropriate level of action for each threat level. In some circumstances, you may not even **need **to take action. But it’s important to keep a watchful eye on an issue so that you’re ready to act if things escalate. 

So, minimizing the damage caused by a crisis is all in the planning. Businesses need to be quick, alert, and prepared to spring into action where necessary. 

# In the event of a crisis, brands need to respond quickly and accurately.

In May 2017, British Airways experienced a crisis.

As thousands of families were traveling on holiday during the half-term break, the airline’s computer systems crashed. As a result, 1,000 flights were affected, and 75,000 people had their holidays ruined. 

With many passengers demanding an explanation, the airline released a vague statement. It revealed that a loss of power to the UK data center had caused their IT systems to fail, and that they were undertaking an investigation to find out exactly what had happened.

However, the energy company responsible for the local power grid responded to British Airways, 

saying that there had been no issues with the power supply. So, what actually happened? 

**Here’s the key message: In the event of a crisis, brands need to respond quickly and accurately.**

British Airways made two big mistakes in this crisis. For starters, by rushing to give some kind of response, the airline compromised the truth: they simply panicked and scapegoated the local power grid. 

Secondly, the airline didn’t clearly communicate with their customers what was going on. As a result, media outlets started to fill in the gaps.

For example, a report from the **Times **shortly after the crisis indicated that the system failure had been caused by an IT worker at British Airways accidentally switching off the power supply. Was this true? Who knows. But it only confused matters further.

As you learned in an earlier blink, consumers take to social media during a crisis to express their concerns. This means that brands in a crisis often find themselves inundated with messages from angry customers. 

A key part of crisis management is knowing how to manage the **volume **of responses you’ll get online. For example, it’s important to post regular updates on what you’re doing to fix the problem at the top of your social media page and website. That way, people don’t have to come to you to ask for information. 

When it comes to responding directly to queries, it’s a good idea to triage which ones you respond to first, based on their importance. Also, prepare a few template responses. That way, if several people are asking the same question, you can use this template to respond to things more quickly. 

A final tip? Make sure you get your facts straight. Think back to the situation with British Airways: had they waited to post accurate information, rather than rushing to issue a response, they may have saved themselves a lot of hassle. 

# Factual communication in a crisis is essential to build trust.

In 2018, the author attended a conference for communications directors. There, she heard the acclaimed journalist and author Kate Adie speak. 

Adie has reported on some of the biggest global news events of the 20th century. She reported from Beijing’s Tiananmen Square in 1989, and brought news to our TV screens of the Iranian Embassy siege in London in 1980. 

During her talk at the conference, Adie spoke of how the environment in which news breaks has changed. With the rise of social media and fake news**,** information gets distorted, and lies are quickly spread. That’s why it’s more important than ever for journalists to deliver the facts.

**Here’s the key message: Factual communication in a crisis is essential to build trust.**

Just as journalists have to pay attention to the facts, so do all communicators. If brands want to maintain the trust of their audience during and after a crisis, they need to deliver clear and **accurate **messages. As Adie explains, “audiences appreciate candor.”

There are four principles of journalism that Adie abides by that are also relevant for brands when

communicating in a crisis. They are: get to the story, find the facts, verify the facts, and report the facts. Let’s unpack these one by one. 

First up, get to the story. In a crisis, don’t rely on **third parties** for your information. Try to get to the source of the issue and chat to the people affected. To get your facts straight, you must experience** **firsthand** **what’s happening.

Next, find the facts. During a crisis, emotions are running high and, as people scramble to make sense of what’s happening, rumors can spread. Brands should strip that all away, and find factual information that explains what happened. 

Then, verify the facts. Before you communicate with your audience, make sure you’re absolutely certain that what you’re telling them is correct. If you go public with what you believe to be true, but it later turns out to be false, you’ll lose the confidence and trust of your audience. 

Last, report the facts in clear, unambiguous language to avoid any misunderstanding. This is particularly important for brand leaders. As we’ll see in the next blink, straightforwardly telling the truth is essential to maintaining a good relationship with your customers.

# Leaders should navigate a crisis with clarity, empathy, and decisiveness.

When Winston Churchill became Prime Minister in 1940, he delivered a speech to the House of Commons. In it, he expressed his intention to unite the people of Great Britain and achieve victory in the Second World War. 

Churchill set a clear and decisive aim for what he wanted the nation to achieve, and he provided a roadmap for how to do it. This is what crisis expert Jonathan Hemus calls setting a **strategic intent – **which is something all business leaders should do at the start of a crisis. 

**Here’s the key message: Leaders should navigate a crisis with clarity, empathy, and decisiveness.**

So, how can leaders set their strategic intent? Well, a good way to start is to picture what things will look like six months down the line. Will your stakeholders be happy about how you responded to the crisis? 

It might help to write down in a clear, simple sentence, what your strategic intent is and what you want the outcome to be. This will help focus your efforts, and those of your team, on one goal. 

For example, if you’re a restaurant owner, and you’ve had to close your premises because of a flood, your strategic intent might be to maintain the loyalty and business of your customers in the long term. As a result, every action you and your employees take will be geared toward retaining the loyalty of those customers.

Another aspect of effective leadership is empathy. When things go wrong, leaders should speak to their audience as human beings. This involves using a sensitive, conversational tone of voice, while avoiding jargon and corporate language. 

Showing empathy also involves knowing when to say you’re sorry. This is what Nick Varney, the CEO of UK theme park Alton Towers did when his company was responsible for an accident.

In 2015, a roller coaster called The Smiler crashed. 16 people were injured and two teenage girls needed leg amputations. A year later, Alton Towers was fined £5 million.

Right from the start of the crisis, Varney addressed the issue personally, and spoke with compassion and regret. He apologized to those injured and took full responsibility for the crash. He also mapped out an action plan to ensure nothing like this would happen again.

As a leader, it’s **you**** **who will set the tone for how your business responds to a crisis. In addition to being smart and strategic about the moves you make, it’s also important to be human. 

# 

**“Crises are human catastrophes that require truly human responses.”**

# Final summary

The key message in these blinks:

**It’s impossible to anticipate every crisis that may occur, but it’s important to be prepared. Knowing how to differentiate between an issue and a catastrophe, having a crisis team at the ready, and laying out your strategic intent as soon as crisis strikes is imperative for ensuring your business survives the storm. When it comes to maintaining the trust of your audience during a crisis, the best thing to do is be honest. It sounds simple, but consumers are more likely to trust brands that treat them like human beings.**

Actionable advice: 

**Analyze, think, then execute.**

When you’re in the midst of a crisis, it can be hard to find a second to pause and reflect. However, doing this is crucial for maintaining a firm grasp of what’s going on. So, next time you feel like you’re getting caught up in the whirlwind, take a second. Evaluate what’s happening, realign your team, and then create a strategy for going forward.
