 (2020) is an optimistic study of its namesake. For centuries, the message seemed to be carved in stone: Humans are evil by nature, and only the veneer of civilization keeps us from terrorizing and murdering each other. The author Rutger Bregman aims to dispel that prejudice and reveal that our essential nature is peaceful and friendly. Perhaps humanity – as recent discoveries from disciplines like archeology and criminology suggest – is actually much less selfish than we think. 


# What’s in it for me? A new picture of humanity.

Humans are innately bad. Just watch the news. We fight. We cheat. We murder and lie and steal. Our beastly natures are only held in check by government, with its laws and regulations, its punishments for every crime.

In such a world, it's the people who think only of themselves – the egoists among us – who get ahead. It's dog-eat-dog out there, and only the fittest will survive.

But wait a minute. Is that really the case? Or is this merely a story we've told ourselves for centuries, a lie so familiar that we mistake it for the truth?

If you look at the latest scientific findings, from archeology to criminology, you'll discover a completely different narrative. We are not bad. We are not selfish. And if you don't believe it, these blinks are here to tell you otherwise.

In these blinks, you’ll learn

- how British and German soldiers managed to celebrate Christmas together during World War I;
- why news is a “nocebo”; and 
- what a **Homo puppy** is. 

# Crises like war don’t automatically make us barbarians.

Do you know what Adolf Hitler, Josef Stalin, Benito Mussolini, Winston Churchill, and Franklin Roosevelt have in common? Yes, all their names are splashed across history. But that’s not all. They were each influenced by the same book: **The Psychology of the Masses**, by the French author Gustave Le Bon.

In the book, Le Bon explains that in crises like war, the masses panic and gradually regress to their true nature, which is violent and selfish. In other words, when people fear for their lives, they become barbarians, concerned with nothing but their own well-being.

Hitler had Le Bon’s ideas in mind when he sent 348 Luftwaffe bombers to London in 1940. He believed that, in the rain of bombs, the people of London would become panicked and barbarous, aiding in their own overthrow. 

What actually happened when the bombs began to fall must have come as a surprise.

**The key message here is: Crises like war don’t automatically make us barbarians.**

In the year before the German Luftwaffe's "Blitz," which killed more than 40,000 people in London alone and destroyed entire neighborhoods, the British public built emergency psychiatric wards in a desperate attempt to prepare for the anticipated panic. 

But these facilities remained empty. Countless observers described how the British went about their daily lives more or less normally, even though air raids had long been underway. Children played, shoppers haggled, and trains continued to run. Londoners calmly drank their tea, despite windows bursting in the background, shattered by the detonation of bomb upon bomb.

Not only did Londoners remain unexpectedly calm – in many ways, they were psychologically and mentally **better** than ever before. Of course there was heartrending grief and deep mourning. But alcohol abuse decreased, and fewer people committed suicide. When it was all over, many Londoners even longed for wartime, because of the widespread camaraderie and solidarity it promoted. People helped each other out far more than they did under normal circumstances.

In short, the people of London defied Hitler’s expectations and disproved Le Bon’s theory. 

The existential threat by no means brought out the worst in people. Rather, it made them **less** selfish. Contrary to Le Bon's thesis, the crisis of the Blitz strengthened British society in many respects. Hitler had achieved the exact opposite of his actual goal.

# The idea persists that humans are, at bottom, selfish.

You’ve surely heard the slogan "Keep Calm and Carry On.” Nowadays, it’s emblazoned on countless T-shirts and cups, endlessly riffed on and satirized. But did you know it was originally developed by the British Ministry of Information to preserve British morale during the Second World War? Posters urging stoic endurance were printed by the million.

Today, many people believe that resilience is a quintessential part of the British character – and that Britons’ calmness during wartime was proof of this. But really, the trait is a **human** one. Countless other examples confirm that people **don’t **panic in the face of disaster, let alone regress to savage impulses. After the September 11 attacks on the Twin Towers, for example, supposedly selfish New Yorkers routinely risked their own lives to save the lives of others. The crisis encouraged solidarity, not savagery.

**Here’s the key message: The idea persists that humans are, at bottom, selfish.**

Time and time again, history shows that extreme situations bring out the best in us. The Disaster Research Center at the University of Delaware, for example, was able to determine, on the basis of 700 field studies, that we behave much less selfishly after disasters. In the wake of catastrophe, the number of murders, thefts, and rapes generally decreases. But despite these facts, the notion that humans become brutes in such circumstances is still widespread. 

After hurricane Katrina devastated New Orleans in 2005, newspapers published fearmongering headlines about looting “gangsters” and murdered infants. In a public statement, Louisiana's governor concluded that Katrina had drawn back the curtain on human nature. Disasters bring out the worst in people, he said, and his words went viral.

Only when the sensationalizing journalists left the city and the news cycle moved on did it become clear what had really happened: the residents had **not** succumbed to anarchic, antisocial behavior. Sociologists discovered that most people had in fact behaved **prosocially.** Looting did occur, but it was usually carried out by Robin Hood-like groups who used looted food to ensure their own survival and that of their fellow human beings – sometimes even banding together with police. So Katrina confirmed more recent scientific findings that strongly suggest that humans are selfless, not selfish.

And yet we persistently cling to our negative image of humanity. This was shown in a study conducted by two American psychologists in 2011. In the study, researchers had subjects evaluate various situations in which people help others. For example, they showed someone returning a lost wallet. To their astonishment, the participants repeatedly attributed selfish motives to those who acted helpfully. Even when the researchers showed participants statistics indicating that the vast majority of people never kept the wallet, most participants remained convinced that the behavior had to be selfishly motivated. It seems that the negativity bias has a firm hold on our imaginations.

# News and fictional stories worsen our view of humanity’s nature.

It doesn’t matter whether you’re on the left or the right side of the political spectrum; almost everyone has a bleak outlook on humanity. But **why** do we see the world so negatively? Why do we think people are fundamentally egoistic? The answer can be found where most of us get our information: the news.

An event is usually only considered newsworthy if it is extraordinary – and, in most cases, that means extraordinarily disastrous. The news is a pageant of pain and misfortune: an attack here, a natural disaster there. You’ll never see a headline announcing that war was **not **declared in Europe today.

The result of all this negativity is predictable enough. It turns people into pessimists.

**The key message here is: News and fictional stories worsen our view of humanity’s nature.**

The news is negative by nature. Every day, we’re exposed to stories that strengthen our belief in the bad. The effect this has on us is similar to that of a **nocebo**. A nocebo is like a placebo, but negative. When you take a placebo, you expect it to have a potent and positive effect on your health, even if, in truth, it contains nothing more than sugar. And this very expectation can, in fact, have positive effects. Nocebos work the other way around. When you take one, you expect a negative outcome – and you may well feel worse as a result. The news is essentially a relentless intravenous drip of nocebo, delivered straight to society’s jugular vein. 

Not only the news has a nocebo effect on our outlook. Fiction also has the power to reinforce our pessimistic self-image. One example is the novel **Lord of the Flies**, a book that helped win its author, William Golding, the Nobel Prize.

Golding wanted to write a "true" story about how children would behave if they landed on a desert island. In the novel, chaos breaks out and several children die. He was celebrated for an allegedly realistic account of what people are actually like without the force of law to prevent them from attacking each other. 

Rutger Bregman had doubts about the underlying truth of this story. He wondered what children would **really** do if they were stranded on a desert island. He dug around for a real **Lord of the Flies **story, and stumbled upon a 1966 account of six children stranded on a remote island in the South Pacific for 15 months.

But these children didn’t behave like the kids in Golding’s novel. In real life, anarchy didn’t reign. The children made a pact to allow no quarrels. Moreover, they managed to start a fire and keep it burning for over a year, and they remained friends long after their rescue.

So which story captures the truth?

# Humans aren’t evil by nature.

Is the heartwarming case of the real **Lord of the Flies** an anomaly – an uplifting exception to the disheartening rule? Or** is **there actually something that determines whether we behave well or badly when cut off from society?

Thinkers have grappled with this question for centuries. The seventeenth-century English philosopher Thomas Hobbes assumed that humans in their natural state are “bad” – they behave only in their own self-interest. He believed that without a state, rules, and laws, humanity would be in a constant “war of all against all.” As we have seen, this worldview is still prevalent today.

But unlike Hobbes, we’re now in a position to go beyond philosophical conjecture. We have evidence from multiple disciplines that offers a more empirical picture of human life before the dawn of civilization. 

**The key message here is: Humans aren’t evil by nature.**

Until recently, both fieldwork and archaeological excavations seemed to confirm Hobbes's view of the world. The US anthropologist Napoleon Chagnon, for example, studied the hunter-gatherer Yanomami people living in the Amazon region. In his 1968 book **The Fierce People **– the best-selling anthropological text of all time – Chagnon postulated that the Yanomami were in a permanent state of war.

The 2011 book **The Better Angels of Our Nature**, by psychologist Steven Pinker, presents a statistical account of the Hobbesian perspective. On the basis of excavated skeletons, Pinker showed that in prehistoric times about 14 percent of people must have been victims of war; in short, they’d been murdered. In modern times, the worldwide murder rate, despite the persistence of war, stands at one percent. In keeping with Hobbes's tradition, Pinker concluded: "It was only civilization that was able to tame the warlike barbarian in us.”

But both Pinker's conclusion and Chagnon's observations about the Yanomami were flawed. For starters, the Yanomami are not representative of how our pre-civilized ancestors lived. When Chagnon published his book, the Yanomami had been in contact with farmers and modern city-dwellers for quite some time. In addition, it turned out that Chagnon had given them axes and machetes during his field research. He’d then asserted that they were particularly violent. 

And Pinker's numbers? They're simply wrong. Twenty of the 21 excavations he cited, which led him to calculate a 14 percent murder rate among hunter-gatherers, came from a time after agriculture had been invented and people had settled down. Hardly robust evidence to support the Hobbesian notion that pre-civilized people were barbaric!

# Human evolution isn't about survival of the fittest, but survival of the friendliest.

And so the question remains: How did we **really** live and behave before we became civilized – that is, before we settled down and began to cultivate land about ten thousand years ago? To answer this question, why not turn to the archivists of the Stone Age – the artists who painted fact and fiction, history and myth, across that age-old canvas, the cave wall?

Cave paintings offer insight into the lives of our nomadic ancestors. But no cave paintings from the nomadic period have been discovered that depict violence or wars. Hunting scenes, however, are depicted often – so the violent deaths that skeletal remains exhibit don’t necessarily testify to human violence. They could just as easily have resulted from conflicts with animals.

**The key message here is: Human evolution isn't about survival of the fittest, but survival of the friendliest.**

Anthropologists studying our past now assume that violence among groups of wandering hunter-gatherers rarely occurred. Instead, they mingled, worked together, and learned from each other. Those who were particularly good at collaboration stood the best chance of survival and had the most children. Nature didn’t favor the strongest or the most selfish but the most cooperative. 

But it’s not enough just to look at cave paintings and skeletal remains when drawing conclusions. Our faces and bodies also hold clues to support this theory. 

Fascinatingly enough, our friendliness is evidenced by our facial features. The faces of modern humans are often softer, rounder, and "cuter" than the faces of our ancestors. In other words, humans have domesticated themselves. As with the evolution of dogs, we’ve been selected for our cute faces and friendly dispositions. We’ve become what Bregman calls **Homo puppy**. 

Our eyes are also evidence of our ultrasocial nature. In the animal kingdom, we’re unique for showing the whites of our eyes. This allows others to know exactly where we’re directing our attention, which enables trust and cooperation. Other primates, with their tinted eyeballs, have much more effective poker faces.

Survival of the friendliest is evident not only in our appearance, but also in our intelligence and the way we learn. Individually, we’re not so smart. Comparisons between babies and monkeys show that we only perform better in one category of intelligence, "social learning" – in which we outperform chimpanzees and orangutans by a wide margin. We’re so good at learning things from each other that one could say cognitive ability and cooperative ability are two sides of the same coin.

# Civilization turned humans violent. 

So we’ve determined that the Hobbesian worldview can’t be true. How, then, did **Homo puppy **become violent in the first place? Because – and this is the elephant in the room – it can’t be denied that we are, despite our puppyish features and dispositions, capable of committing violent acts.

Let’s consider the history of philosophy once again. Nearly one hundred years after Hobbes concluded that human nature is base and barbarous, the French Romantic philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau reached the opposite conclusion. In his view, humanity isn’t innately evil and corrupt. It’s fundamentally good, but was corrupted by civilization.

**The key message here is: Civilization turned humans violent. **

Recent archeological investigations reveal that, near the end of the first ice age, when societies became more settled, humans began building the first military fortifications. Around this same time, archers began appearing in cave paintings, and excavated skeletons from the period actually **do** exhibit clear evidence of human violence. And, if you think about it, it's pretty obvious **why **we became violent: there was now land to fight over and crops to defend. In short, people suddenly possessed property.

Property made us suspicious of other people. Before, when we were still hunter-gatherers, there were looser definitions of what belonged to whom. Where **we** belonged was also unclear. Wandering hunters and gatherers had no fixed tribe. They would encounter new groups and simply merge with them. All this changed when humans started settling down. We evolved from wandering cosmopolitans to mistrustful xenophobes.

The emergence of violence can also be linked to the development of hierarchies within civilizations. Prior to the establishment of large and populous settlements, rulers found it difficult to remain in power, because nomadic life did not allow inequality to take hold. Paleoanthropological evidence suggests that hunter-gatherer societies developed shame-based systems to hold individuals in check; whenever someone attempted to control others, the group would use shame and peer pressure to cut the person back down to size.

But with the emergence of sedentary societies around 10,000 years ago, powerful people could no longer be dethroned with a bit of gossip and teasing. Leaders could suddenly gather warriors around them, which helped cement their power. And now that rulers command vast armies, it’s not as if they can be dethroned with just a disparaging comment or tweet. 

# Our capacity for empathy also has a dark side.

Maybe all these arguments seem pretty logical to you. Science is only substantiating what many have believed all along – that humans are essentially good and would prefer to do others no harm. But how do we square this with history’s atrocities, such as the Holocaust?

Well, the answer to this is hidden in another question – a question that Allied scientists asked themselves in 1944: How could it be that even in the face of immediate defeat, German soldiers continued to fight? In fact, research revealed that German Wehrmacht soldiers fought almost twice as effectively as Allied soldiers. Even their desertion rate was close to zero. This puzzled the Allied researchers. Just what was going on with the Nazis?

**The key message here is: Our capacity for empathy also has a dark side.**

One of these researchers, the American sociologist Morris Janowitz, had been commissioned to find out why the German soldiers fought so doggedly, despite being vastly outnumbered and utterly surrounded. Like other psychologists of his time, Janowitz could only account for their actions in one way: the soldiers were under the sway of an ideology, brainwashed to love the fatherland obsessively. 

Allied forces attempted to fight this ideology with propaganda of their own. The Psychological Warfare Division dropped countless pamphlets over German territory, each with the same message: Your position is hopeless! The Allies will prevail! But it didn’t work. The Nazis ignored them. And why? Because the researchers’ assumptions about the Germans’ motivations were all wrong.

Only when Morris was given the chance to interrogate captured German soldiers directly did he realize that they weren’t brainwashed. They fought so doggedly because they didn’t want to abandon their neighbors and friends. Most German soldiers were not fanatically devoted to the Nazi cause. They were simply comrades and good friends. Nazi generals knew this well, and took pains to promote camaraderie in their divisons. 

So is it possible that even violent criminals are driven by communality and selflessness? To judge from the motives of German soldiers in the Second World War, the answer is a clear yes. They were guided by a very human feeling: empathy. This may seem counterintuitive, but our capacity for empathy sometimes blinds us to the suffering of others.

After all, we can only feel empathy for a small number of people. It’s a bit like the zoom function on a camera. We feel empathy for the people around us – the people we can smell, feel, and hear. But being zoomed in in that way leaves a lot out. It’s worth remembering that empathy inevitably excludes more people than it includes. 

# 

“**Empathy and xenophobia go hand in hand. They’re two sides of the same coin.”**

# Humans avoid violence whenever possible, even in life-or-death situations.

Empathy is double-edged: it cuts two ways. It ensures that we fight for our family, friends, and neighbors. But it also enables us to kill for them. When it’s a matter of life and death on the battlefield, we depart from our friendly disposition and resort to violence – or so we often assume.

But this assumption is also false. We don’t suddenly become barbarians on the battlefield. Even in extreme situations like war, when face-to-face with the enemy, humans generally find it very difficult to pull the trigger and kill another person. 

**Here’s the key message: Humans avoid violence whenever possible, even in life-or-death situations.**

One of the first people to study this effect was the American colonel and historian Samuel Marshall. In 1943, Marshall attempted to capture the Japanese island of Makin with his 300-person battalion. Despite their superior training and numbers, they failed. Marshall was surprised, and decided to investigate.

Marshall, in a manner unusual for the military, interviewed his soldiers and encouraged them to be honest. What he discovered was astonishing: only 36 of the 300 soldiers had used their weapons. Each soldier hesitated to shoot, whether he’d excelled in training or not. 

The death statistics of British soldiers in the Second World War are also telling. The vast majority of them – a full 75 percent – were killed by bombs or mines, meaning that relatively few were shot by someone who had to look them in the face. And even more difficult than shooting people is stabbing them. At the Battle of Waterloo, fewer than one percent of wounds were inflicted by bayonet, even though bayonets were affixed to tens of thousands of rifles.

Series like** Game of Thrones** may suggest that it’s easy to kill another person. But it's not. The vast majority of people feel a deep aversion to killing.

We can see this in a famous event from the First World War. Incredibly, on Christmas Day in 1914, German and British soldiers defied orders and suspended fighting. Instead they drank, exchanged gifts, and sang Christmas carols together in the trenches.

Commanders had to force their soldiers to resume fighting. Even then, though threatened with prison sentences and worse, soldiers continued to send each other messages secretly about when the next attack would take place, assuring each other that they would aim their fire too high. 

# We need a new, more realistic view of humanity. 

As we’ve seen, war did not occur until we became civilized. The theory that the veneer of civilization falls away as soon as we’re in crisis mode is simply wrong. We often don't even become violent when violence might make sense, like during wartime. So we’re really not as bad as we think. And if we can internalize this, we may be able to develop a new and better society.

However, if we continue to assume that people will only behave morally under threat of punishment, then there will, of course, be consequences. More and more of the population will need to be locked away – as we see in the United States, where inmates are often crammed into cage-like cells and may be let out for only one hour per week. We need to pause and ask ourselves, Does such treatment truly rehabilitate people convicted of crimes? Does it really promote moral behavior?

**The key message here is: We need a new, more realistic view of humanity. **

Halden Prison, in Norway, offers a less-punitive approach. Each inmate has his own large room with a flat-screen TV. In Halden, there is no gross cafeteria food – the prisoners cook for themselves. In their free time they can go to the prison's own recording studio or to the climbing wall, and if the weather is nice, they barbecue in the evening together with the guards. The guards aren’t even armed.

You may think, Surely this can’t be true? Norwegians commit crimes and then are practically **rewarded **with a cushy stay in prison? The author initially felt this way, until the prison director, Tom Eberhardt, asked him a simple question: Who would you rather have as a neighbor – someone who’d just been released from a typical American prison, or someone who’d been released from a modern Norwegian one?

Statistically, the answer is clear: people who’ve been incarcerated in harsh prisons are ticking time bombs. At 60 percent, the USA has one of the highest recidivism rates worldwide. Yet recidivism among people who serve time in the Norwegian prison Bastøy, which is run similarly to Halden, is only 16 percent. In this sense, Bastøy is the most successful prison worldwide. And because the recidivism rates are so much lower, Norwegian prisons save a lot of money each year. 

The idea behind the Norwegian model is that if we treat inmates as though they are responsible, then they will **become** responsible. And the concept seems to work. Once we believe that most people are good, everything changes. If we’re able to do that, we can start reorganizing not only prisons but also businesses, schools, and – why not? – entire governments.

# Final summary

The key message in these blinks:

**For thousands of years, we’ve cultivated a false self-image of humans as inherently selfish. As a result, we often distrust each other. But it’s neither civilization nor the fear of punishment that prevents violent and selfish behavior. In evolutionary terms, we are neither egoists nor murderers: we are friendly and cooperative, as we can see in the way we behave during crises. So it's high time for a new, more positive view of humanity.**
