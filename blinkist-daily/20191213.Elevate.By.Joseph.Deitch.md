 (2018) is an indispensable guide to upping your game and living your life to the fullest. Whether you’re looking for a career boost or want to bring more meaning and joy into your private affairs, these blinks contain an arsenal of tips and tricks to help you take things to the next level.


# What’s in it for me? A pro’s guide to personal growth.

The modern world is bursting with data. All this information can be overwhelming. What does it all mean and, more to the point, what’s the best way of achieving success and satisfaction in **your** life? 

Luckily, you don’t have to try to figure it out on your own. In these blinks, we’ll turn to entrepreneur, author, and lifelong wisdom-seeker Joseph Deitch for help. Born in 1950, Deitch’s chameleon-like career has seen him excel in industries as different as financial planning and entertainment. 

But whatever he turned his hand to, there’s always been a guiding thread: a commitment to personal growth and a burning desire to achieve excellence. And that’s just what we’ll be exploring as we unpack Deitch’s toolkit for upping your personal and professional game. 

Along the way, you’ll learn 

- why listening is the key to learning; 
- how rewards can help you reach your goals; and 
- why love is all you need. 

# You can solve many problems and get what you want by simply asking the right questions. 

How do you solve problems in your life? As you think of various techniques, you might be forgetting something obvious: taking a moment to think things through and asking yourself what the solution might be. It’s a deceptively simple approach that delivers incredible results. 

Take it from the author, who spends his winters in Boston, Massachusetts. It’s a cold, grey, and dreary place and, like lots of Bostonians, he suffers from a mild form of winter depression. For a long time, he dreaded the arrival of November. 

There was one highlight, however – Thanksgiving. That got the author thinking. What, he asked himself, was it that made the annual holiday so enjoyable? More to the point, what could he do to make the rest of November as enjoyable as Thanksgiving? 

The answer? Getting together with friends and family. And that was the solution to the author’s winter blues. Today, he plans parties, excursions, meetups, and game-evenings with the folks he loves. It’s had a miraculous effect. Rather than despairing about the coming winter, he actually looks forward to it! 

Here’s another easy way to tackle problems: don’t just ask yourself what you want, but **how **you’re going to get it. Think back to when you were a kid and how much you wanted sweets or that new toy your parents refused to buy you. Children typically react to these frustrations by whining or even crying. This is a self-pity trap that you need to learn to avoid. 

The trick is to ask the right question: What do I need to do in order to get what I want? The author taught his son, Matt, to take this approach, and it’s worked wonders. When Matt wants something – a video game, say – he realizes that he has to do something to earn it, like cleaning the dishes after dinner or completing other household chores. 

As you can imagine, that’s a great attitude to take to life’s many challenges and frustrations. Rather than passively grumbling about your lot, it encourages you to put yourself in the driving seat and proactively solve problems for yourself. 

# Listening to others is not always easy, but it provides valuable information and helps you improve.

If you want to learn something new, you have to listen to others – after all, when you’re the one doing the talking, you inevitably end up saying what you already know. Whether you’re with your friends and family or in a business meeting, listening is the best way of getting information and finding out what you can improve on. 

Taking feedback on board can be tricky, though, especially when it’s critical. The author witnessed just how hard this can be a couple of years back, when he attended a seminar in which participants received feedback from their colleagues. 

Now, because every attendee was receiving comments from multiple sources, they knew the comments weren’t arbitrary. One participant, however, had a meltdown and started shouting about how the feedback he had been given wasn’t fair. Ironically, this temper tantrum confirmed what his colleagues had said – that he always assumed the folks he worked with were out to get him. 

That clearly isn’t a healthy approach. So how can you cultivate your listening skills? Let’s take a look at some easy tools to help you become a better listener. 

The first thing you’ll need to do is commit to listening. If you’re in the habit of interrupting or ignoring others, you need to recognize this and make a conscious choice to change your behavior. 

The second step is realizing that listening is an **active process**. The idea isn’t to simply sit there and let the words wash over you as you idly contemplate what you’re going to eat for dinner that evening. True listening means engaging with what’s being said, noticing when you become distracted, and making an effort to refocus your attention. 

Finally, you’ll want to go into conversations with an open mind. You’ll only ever hear what someone is saying if you drop your assumptions and take their argument on its own merits. Remember, you can always decide whether you agree or disagree after they’ve said their bit!  

# 

**“Listening is a never-ending journey upon an ever-improving road.”**

# The way we think and talk affects our lives and shapes the way we feel. 

Every night before bed, the author told his son Matt that he was an excellent sleeper who could always drop off whatever the situation. Amazingly, this worked and Matt has never had a problem getting a good night’s sleep. What’s going on here – how does this work? 

The answer might surprise you. How we think and talk about things actually affects our lives. Think of the human brain as a computer. Like a PC, it can be programmed. Rather than using code, however, it’s programmed using regular, everyday language. 

When you think or talk about yourself in negative terms like, “I can’t sleep at night” or “No matter what I do, I just can’t lose weight,” you’re encoding these messages in your brain. And the more you repeat them, the truer they become. Why is that? Well, you’re basically hardwiring yourself to run negative programs.

Luckily, this problem can be fixed. The way to do that is to reverse the code and consciously think and talk about yourself in positive terms. Repeating ideas like, “I can sleep easily every night” or, “I can lose weight with little effort” makes it easier to get a full night’s shut-eye and shed those extra pounds!

Feelings can also be manipulated in this way. Put differently, you can **choose **whether you feel bad or good.

Not convinced? Try this exercise. Dim the lights in your room, slump down in your chair and focus your attention on a negative experience in your life for ten minutes. How do you feel? Pretty terrible, right? 

Now try the opposite. Brighten the lights, strike a confident, upright pose and focus your mind on a great memory that makes you smile or laugh. Raise your arms in the air and shout “Yes!” a couple of times. Chances are, you’ll feel a whole lot better!

It just goes to show how much we can influence our emotions. Next time you’re feeling low, think back to this little experiment and remind yourself that **you’re **responsible for how you feel. 

# Positive, immediate, and certain motivation is the best way to achieve your goals.

Have you had a boss who inspired you to go the extra mile and produce the best work of your career? If so, you’ve probably wondered what it was that made them such a great motivator. Surprisingly, it’s a lot less complicated than you might think – in fact, it all comes down to a couple of straightforward rules. 

Here’s the most important point: if you want to get the best out of others, you need to give them **positive, immediate and certain motivation**. Let’s break that down.

Lots of folks cling to the old-fashioned idea that the best way to get results out of workers is to scare them. The latest research shows that this is a damaging fallacy. In reality, negative reinforcement undermines performance. That’s because scare tactics encourage people to do the bare minimum necessary to avoid punishment. 

That’s where the **positive** part comes into the equation. If you reward good work positively, employees are more likely to give it their all. This is especially true when those rewards are **immediate**. Thanks to the way our brains are wired, most of us will, given the choice, prefer $1,000 today to receiving $2,000 next year. As a result, we all work harder when we know we’ll see the fruits of our labor sooner rather than later. 

Rewards also need to be **certain**. Think of it this way. If your company is flaky when it comes to bonuses and sometimes goes back on old promises, you’re unlikely to feel motivated. If rewards are fixed and non-negotiable, on the other hand, you’re much more likely to push on and hit your targets. 

These principles don’t just apply to companies, though – you can also use them to motivate yourself. Imagine that you want to lose weight. As anyone who has been on a diet will tell you, this can be a grueling experience, because eating tasteless, low-fat food feels like a punishment.

Add in the fact that the rewards are neither immediate nor certain, as well as our monkey-like craving for immediate gratification, and you can see why it’s so hard to stick to your new dietary plan.

So here’s an idea: make dieting a positive experience by preparing small yet delicious meals and creating a rewards system that gives you little delights each time you hit a milestone. You could, for example, reward yourself with a trip to the spa or a night out with friends for every 2 lbs you lose.

# Structures help you to avoid mistakes, while conserving your energy prevents burn-out. 

Life has a way of throwing us curveballs. When that happens, we’re quick to adapt. If a close friend or family member gets seriously ill, for example, we often discover previously unknown resources to structure our time and get a huge number of things done.

But what if there was a way of doing that every day, not just in times of crisis? Here’s the good news – there is. Let’s see how.

Whether it’s to-do lists, morning or evening routines or a weekly cleaning plan, structures all have one thing in common: they help you use your time more efficiently and avoid mistakes. 

Look at the aviation industry. Today, airline pilots work their way through an extensive security checklist before take-off. This is strictly enforced in countries like the US, and the results speak for themselves. Since the introduction of such tests, the number of accidents involving aircraft has decreased dramatically. 

Doctors and nurses have a similar approach and use checklists to create structure in their diagnostic procedures. Studies have shown that these lists have reduced the number of slip-ups and mistakes in medical environments like hospitals. 

And another tip: don’t waste resources like time and energy. Here it’s worth taking a tip from nature. In the natural world, resources are scarce and precious, which is why every organism uses the minimum amount of energy necessary to sustain itself. 

This also applies in everyday settings. Imagine you’re about to lift a heavy suitcase. If you’re expending too little energy, you won’t be able to get it off the ground; expend too much, however, and you’ll end up swinging the suitcase around and knocking stuff over. 

Now think of the activities needed to complete a project. The same principle is at work. Too little effort and you won’t get anything done; too much and you’ll eat into your energy reserves and soon find yourself running on an empty tank. Put differently, you’ll burn out. 

# Power naps are a great way to make up for lost sleep, but they can’t replace it entirely.

Professional success and personal fulfillment are both built on the same foundation stones. One of the most important and often overlooked parts of this structure? Sleep. If you’re struggling to get a proper night’s rest, don’t worry – in this blink, we’ll explore hacks for quality rest. 

Let’s start with power naps. When you’re tired, there’s often little point trying to press ahead with your work. You’re guaranteed to be working inefficiently and wind up with something that falls below your usual standards. So here’s the alternative: take a short nap and refuel before returning to the task at hand. 

The reason power naps give you such a boost is easy to explain. Twenty to thirty-minute naps are almost entirely made up of **rapid eye movement **or **REM **sleep. This is particularly good for your cognitive and biological functions. More importantly, your body doesn’t fall into **deep sleep**. This means you don’t wake up feeling groggy and confused.

If you’re still not convinced, take it from Thomas Edison, Leonardo da Vinci, and Eleonore Roosevelt – three of history’s most successful power nappers!

There is one caveat to bear in mind, however. As effective as power naps can be at giving you a much-needed cognitive boost, they can’t replace regularly getting a full night’s sleep. Unfortunately, sleeping disturbances are on the rise and lots of people are struggling to get that. 

If you’re one of them, it’s worth noting that medication should always be treated as a last resort. Before you go to the doctor, try building plenty of exercise into your daily routine. Combine that with natural remedies from traditional Chinese medicine or Ayurvedic cures and you might find that, in time, your sleeping problems clear up.

# It’s worth investing a lot of energy into a new venture, and keeping track of your time. 

It takes a huge amount of energy to get an airplane off the ground, but once it reaches altitude it can cruise while burning minimal amounts of fuel. The momentum achieved by that initial spurt, in other words, is enough to keep it in the air. 

What does this have to do with your personal and professional life? Quite a lot, actually. Like an airplane, you need to expend a lot of energy when you launch new projects. Start half-heartedly, by contrast, and you’ll soon find yourself out of runway. That’s when you hit a wall and give up. 

The author, for example, spent many years trying to learn how to ski. Every now and then, he would make it up a mountain. Because he didn’t go skiing regularly, however, he never got good enough to really enjoy the sport. In the end, he called it quits. 

Whether it’s skiing, picking up a new language, or mastering an unfamiliar skill, you have to fully commit at the beginning of the process. That’s just what the author did when he decided to take up yoga. He threw himself into his new venture by embarking on a 30-day yoga challenge. This was a great way of getting over that awkward early stage and reaping the full benefits of the practice. Today, yoga is a part of his everyday routine! 

Okay, you know how important commitment is, but where do you find the time for your project? Well, here’s the thing: you have more of it than you might think. 

To find out just how much time you actually have, you’ll need to analyze how you’re spending it. Grab a notebook and record your activities over the next two weeks, jotting down what you’re doing every six minutes. This will give you a highly detailed overview of what you’re doing with your days. 

Chances are, you’ll be appalled at how much time you waste watching TV, using social media, or simply worrying about things. And awareness is half the battle – once you can see how fruitless this use of time is, you can start focusing on things that enrich your life like learning to play an instrument, spending more time with your family, or exercising. 

# Bringing more love into your life and remembering the importance of touch will make you happier. 

As the famous Beatles song has it, “All you need is love.” On some level, we all know that love makes our lives happier and fuller. Unfortunately, we often overlook this basic insight and neglect this vital matter. That has to change. 

Love is contagious. Spend time around a loving person and you’ll find yourself feeling much more connected and mellow. That’s why it’s so important to surround yourself with loving influences. This can be as simple as spending more time with the folks who love you and make you feel good. 

Then there are children. Kids are masters of the art of unconditional love. Make an effort to hang out with these little bundles of loving enthusiasm and you’re sure to learn a thing or two about affection. Spirituality is another great way of getting in touch with your loving self and nourishing your heart. 

And here’s a final tip: if you’re struggling to make loving connections, just picture how puppies behave when they meet one another. This is the energy you should be channeling when you’re getting to know new people – fun, easy-going, and playful. 

Love isn’t an abstract idea, either – it’s also about touch. Whether it’s in a platonic or erotic context, physical contact is one of the most effective ways of expressing love. No wonder, then, that touching and being touched has been shown to improve our physiological and mental health!

A good way of integrating this into everyday encounters is to hug people. That’s obviously trickier in some places than others – restrained cultures like that of the northeastern US states, for example, don’t exactly encourage this behavior. But if you make an effort to overcome your natural reticence, you’ll be amazed how much closer you feel to those around you.  

And when it comes to your partner, don’t underestimate the importance of nurturing slow sex and tenderness to your mental and physical well-being. Here you can take a tip from the Indian **Kama Sutra**, an ancient text written around BCE 200 to help lovers transform sex into an emotional and spiritual experience, as well as a physical one. 

And there you have it – everything you need to start elevating your life from learning to ask the right questions, to cultivating love in your day-to-day life!

# Final summary

The key message in these blinks:

**Life isn’t simply about going through the motions – it’s about elevating yourself to ever higher levels of proficiency and, ultimately, achieving satisfaction and success. But here’s the catch: oftentimes, we just don’t know where to start this process. Fortunately, it’s not as hard as you might think. The place to start? Ask yourself what you want to change in your life, and refuse to give up until you have a firm answer. Once you’ve clarified that question, it’s all about saving time, structuring your days for maximum efficiency and taking care of your physical and mental health. **

Actionable advice:

**Find out what the people around you want. **

Do you ever feel frustrated because the folks around you just don’t seem to get what you’re driving at? Or maybe you’ve noticed that your partner seems grumpy but you can’t figure out what’s wrong? Well, whatever it is that’s vexing you, it’s time to put an end to the suspense. Here’s how: stop pretending you’re psychic, and start communicating! If you want to solve an issue, you need to ask what other people want. Once you know that, it’s much easier to give it to them or, if that’s not possible, rationally explain why you can’t.
