He also gives practical tips and strategies for how to use meditation to improve overall well-being and effectiveness. 


# What’s in it for me? Learn the modern science and ancient wisdom of true happiness

What’s your goal in life? Maybe it’s to achieve the job of your dreams, start a family, or travel the world. Perhaps it’s a combination of all three. But for many of us, happiness is a goal in itself. 

Throughout history, people across different cultures and religious and spiritual traditions have traveled miles along dusty plains and climbed the steepest mountains to reach **enlightenment **– that is, the highest peak of human possibility. These people sought to become as wise, strong, loving, and happy as they could be. But the path there wasn’t always easy.

In these blinks, we’ll take a look at how to reach true happiness and fulfillment by embarking on a seven-step journey of **awakening. **

Using author Rick Hanson’s **neurodharma **approach – which fuses modern neuroscience with teachings from the **Theravada **Buddhist tradition – we’ll look at practices for becoming more mindful, balanced, and connected to the world.

You’ll also learn

- why meditation affects the brain positively;
- how to steady your mind and concentrate better; and
- practices for healing past pain.

# There are seven ways of being that form the basis of true awakening.

If you’ve ever hiked up a mountain, you know how tough it can be. Not only is it physically exhausting, there are also obstacles and challenges along your way to the top. 

Well, that’s what it’s like when achieving happiness, wisdom, and strength – qualities the author refers to as the “heights of human potential.” 

We may all want to reach these heights – the metaphorical top of the mountain – but to get there, we have to tread a path of **awakening **first. 

**Here’s the key message: There are seven ways of being that form the basis of true awakening. **

Many religious or spiritual traditions have their own versions of how to climb the mountain to happiness. But all of them seem to follow the same seven steps – **steadiness, lovingness, fullness, wholeness, nowness, allness, **and** timelessness.** Mastering these **seven ways of being **leads to **enlightenment –** otherwise known as **full awakening**.

Developing a greater sense of fullness, wholeness, or any other aspect of awakening involves three kinds of practice: **Let be**, **let go **and **let in. **Let’s take a look at these one by one.

First up, **let be.**

When you start on your path to enlightenment, you may notice a number of thoughts and emotions rising within you. Learning to let be** **means accepting these feelings as they come, and allowing yourself to feel them wholeheartedly.

Next up is **let go**, which means releasing what is painful or harmful. This can take the form of easing tension in your body, venting negative thoughts, or distancing yourself from desires that hurt you or others.

Last is **let in.** Once you’ve removed any negative thoughts or emotions, you can replace them with something positive. For instance, you could focus on developing new skills if you’ve not done well on a project, or on becoming more grateful and resilient after receiving negative feedback.

Think of it this way: If your mind is like a garden, you can pull out the weeds and plant flowers in their place.

So developing the seven ways of being requires that you experience feelings openly, accept them, and let them be. When you do this, you train yourself to be more mindful, loving, and content. 

In the following blinks, we’ll take a look at how to practice these seven steps to enlightenment in our everyday lives. But first, let’s take a look at the neuroscience behind awakening, and how we can rewire our brains to improve our well-being. 

# Changing our neural activity can enhance our psychological well-being.

Have you ever wondered why we can taste coffee? How we remember where we left our keys? What about why we feel so incredibly sad after a breakup?

Well, it all boils down to our nervous system – and its headquarters, the brain. Our every sensation, every thought, and every desire depend on **neural activity. **

Scientists have proven that there’s a link between what we feel and what our brains do — and we can use this connection in practical ways.

**The key message in this blink is: Changing our neural activity can enhance our psychological well-being.**

Our brains are made up of 85 billion neurons connected in a huge network. So, as you’re reading or listening to these blinks, for example, neurons – or the cells that transfer information around the body – pulse in rhythm together. This creates waves of electrical activity that our neurological receptors interpret as words or sound. 

But how can we control this neural activity? The best way is to use mindfulness and meditation, both of which have been proven to have brain-changing effects.

In fact, people who meditate for long periods of time develop greater control over their **amygdala.** This is the almond-shaped region near the center of the brain that plays a key role in processing experiences and emotions. 

The amygdala also acts as an alarm bell against anything painful or threatening. If an angry face passes you in the street, or you receive bad news after your annual physical, your amygdala triggers a hormonal stress response. So getting more control over it can actually help reduce stress and limit overreactions.

That’s where meditation can help! Veteran meditators who’ve had thousands of hours of lifetime practice experience remarkable long-term changes in their brains.

Take the experienced practitioners of Tibetan Buddhism, for example. They possess crazy-high levels of **gamma-range brain-wave activity, **which is associated with enhanced learning. These meditators also demonstrate a remarkable calm when bracing themselves for pain, and they recover quickly afterward. 

We’ve learned that meditation can foster neurological changes in the brain that lead to greater resilience and improved well-being. But it goes a lot further than that. 

According to recent research, your brain “takes its shape” from what you dedicate your attention to. So by using meditation to develop a greater sense of steadiness, lovingness – and the other five ways of being – you’ll be weaving these qualities into your own nervous system.

**“Neurodharma is the truth of the mind grounded in the truth of the body.”**

# The first step toward awakening is steadying the mind, which requires us to concentrate while meditating.

When the author first began to meditate, he didn’t take things **that **seriously. 

He was just finishing his college degree, and meditation happened to be a growing trend. After class, he would sit in the Southern California hills with his long hair and bamboo flute, trying to **look** like he was meditating. 

After practicing a few times, though, he realized something **real **was taking place. When he closed his eyes and began to breathe slowly, he noticed a sense of calm, quiet, and “untroubled awareness” wash over him. 

A few years later, the author found himself describing these experiences in a meditation workshop. His teacher’s response? “But what about concentration?”

**The key message here is: The first step toward awakening is steadying the mind, which requires us to concentrate while meditating.**

Learning how to focus our attention is a key aspect of** ****steadying the mind** – the first step on the path to awakening. 

Concentration is one of the three pillars of Buddhist practice. It stabilizes our attention and helps us focus acutely on our meditation practice. We open ourselves up to profound **insight **when we have razor-sharp concentration**.**

The problem is that modern society constantly bombards us with distractions, from our phones ringing off the hook to work emails arriving in our inboxes at all hours. And, it’s not just technology that’s the problem. Our relationships, families, and even health issues can hijack our attention, making us less able to focus on the tasks in front of us. 

To calm this** **“monkey mind,” we need to cultivate **neural factors **that promote concentration and stillness in the mind. We can do this through meditation. So let’s take a look at a typical **focused attention **practice. 

Start by concentrating on a specific **object of attention**. For example, you could focus on the image of a buoy in a warm tropical sea.** **Or you could concentrate on your breath –** **the rise and fall of your chest as it expands and deflates, and the air passing in and out of your nose and mouth.

During meditation, other thoughts, sensations and images will naturally bubble up into awareness. Try not to engage with them. Instead, lead your wandering mind back to your object of attention.

Even if it seems hard at first, your attention will become steadier over time. The mind is like a muscle: the more we use it, the stronger it will get. 

# Living with a warm heart means being compassionate to yourself and others.

In the early 2000s, the author attended a conference at Spirit Rock Meditation Center in Woodacre, California. He went to hear the Dalai Lama speak.

While the Dalai Lama said a number of insightful things, the author mostly remembers his bodyguard. Throughout the conference, he stood at ease like a dancer, smiling at everyone in the room. Even though he was there to defend the Dalai Lama – and was trained to use force if necessary – there was no sense of threat from him. Instead, he radiated happiness and love.

**The key message in this blink is: Living with a warm heart means being compassionate to yourself and others.**

The path to awakening can sometimes seem focused on the individual’s **internal world**. But actually, many of its elements are interpersonal.

In Buddhism, in which community is essential, part of being happy includes being kind and compassionate to others, and making them happy, too. This is what the author refers to as **warming the heart **–** **the second practice of awakening. 

We can cultivate the qualities of kindness and compassion through **compassion-focused meditations**. This activates the parts of the brain that stimulate positive emotions and help us connect with others. 

One of the author’s favorite practices for this meditation comes from the **Theravada** Buddhist tradition. It involves offering four kinds of warm wishes to five types of people. 

The four wishes are for ourselves and others to be “safe, healthy, happy, and at ease.” And the five types of people who can receive them are a benefactor – that is, someone we appreciate – a friend, a neutral person, someone who is challenging to be around, and, lastly, ourselves. 

Here’s how it works. 

First, be aware of your body: imagine the breath flowing in and out. Then, choose a benefactor. Focus on the warm feelings that person inspires within you. Then say these phrases to yourself:** **“May you be safe, may you be healthy, may you be happy, may you live with ease.” 

It’s okay if your attention moves to negative situations or issues. Simply return your focus to the feeling of being with the person you care about. Then repeat this with a friend, a challenging person, and so on. 

The path to awakening isn’t one we tread alone. It involves creating positive thoughts, feelings, and intentions within ourselves** **that we then direct out to the wider world.

# We can heal our suffering by learning the practice of resting in fullness.

The author realized early on in his career that unhappiness is common, and it can take many forms. Some people live their lives feeling the intense pain of trauma, while others feel subtly unfulfilled. 

These experiences are what Buddha himself called **suffering** – which he named as the **First Noble Truth** of human existence. 

All of us experience suffering at some point. But some of us carry the weight of suffering throughout our lives. And the burden can sometimes be too much to bear. 

**Here’s the key message: We can heal our suffering by learning the practice of resting in fullness.**

Much of our suffering comes from **craving.** This is the sense that something is missing from our lives, as if a need hasn’t been met. Craving can manifest in all kinds of ways, like chasing pleasure, numbing pain, or clinging to relationships that don’t serve us. 

There’s a silver lining, though. Buddhist teachings tell us that we can liberate ourselves from craving – and therefore from suffering. We can do this by **resting in fullness,** which is the third step on the path to awakening.

One practice for resting in fullness follows the HEAL acronym. It involves replacing negative material with positive material. The negative material could be the sad memory of having been left out of something as a child, for example. And the positive material could be the happy feeling of being included by a group of friends. 

Let’s begin at the top.

First, we start with the H, which is to **have **an experience of the positive material.** **This basically means bringing your awareness to the time and place you felt these happy feelings. 

Next, the E ensures you **enrich **the emotion by staying with the experience. Allow yourself to feel it in your body.

Then the A – **absorb **the positive material. Imagine it sinking into you like the sun’s warm, soothing rays. Also, be aware of what feels good about it.

Lastly, the tough part is the L: **link **the positive material to the negative material. Do this by bringing the negative material into your awareness while still holding the positive material prominently and powerfully. Then, after a few breaths, let go of the negative. Imagine it diminishing like a balloon emptying of air. 

Resting in fullness is the art of feeling content. It helps us heal past wounds so that we may press forward on the path to enlightenment. 

# Strengthening neural factors can help us foster a sense of wholeness and live in the now.

What does it mean to feel truly whole? And can anyone ever achieve this feeling?

**Wholeness**, the fourth step to awakening, is reached by accepting yourself fully – the good and the bad – and doing this despite the mind’s natural tendencies toward negativity! 

Thankfully, we can all achieve wholeness – if we put in the work.

**The key message in this blink is: ****Strengthening neural factors can help us foster a sense of wholeness and live in the now.**

Let’s turn to neurology to see **why **the brain can make us feel unfulfilled. 

**Midline cortical networks** are to blame! They run along the midline of the brain’s topmost regions and are divided into two sections. The network toward the front drives problem-solving, performing tasks, and making plans. The** default mode network** toward the back drives ruminating and daydreaming. 

Since the brain’s default network drives rumination, we often get lost in thought throughout the day. In fact, studies show that the average person has a wandering mind about half the time** **they’re awake!** **

This much thought can have negative consequences, especially since the midline networks open the brain to self-referential thinking. The more the mind wanders, the more it can tilt toward negativity, anxiety, or self-criticism. 

So how can we change this?

Well, expanding the brain’s **lateral networks** helps. These neural networks, located on either side of the brain, perform opposite the midline networks, suppressing them when active. They also help with** holistic** processing, which allows us to literally see the bigger picture, like when we look at a panoramic view.

Strengthening our lateral networks fosters a **sense of wholeness**, even during difficult times – and many practices can help us do this.

One of them,** gestalt awareness**, promotes visualization of things as a whole, unified scene. This can be taken literally, such as when we bring awareness to our whole bodies while moving, or it can be metaphorical, as when we imagine our minds as a vast sky where thoughts and feelings represent clouds. 

Practicing gestalt awareness also helps us make the fifth step toward awakening — **receiving nowness**. This means being present in the moment, and not worrying about the past or future.

Mastering these two steps allows us to let go of negativity, feel more complete within ourselves, and, ultimately, live in the now.

**“See what happens when you regard a situation as more like a cloud than a brick.”**

# Well-being increases when we decrease our sense of self and instead open into allness.

If someone were to ask you what is meant by a “self,” what would you say?

Many people understand the word** self** to describe the essence of a human being – an intangible something that distinguishes one person from the next. Other words related to the self include ego, identity, I, and me. 

Think about it this way: a self is a kind of “being” inside you who looks out at the world through your eyes. 

The problem is, having a strong sense of self is often what causes our suffering. It makes us take things personally, act defensively, and even get possessive over others. That’s why dissolving the notion of the self is so crucial to achieving happiness. 

**The key message here is: Well-being increases when we decrease our sense of self and instead open into allness.**

Let’s first look at what this actually means. 

When the Buddha coached people through the process of releasing the self, he encouraged practices that address three specific characteristics. The first was to release **identification** with the self – or, in other words, the idea that “that is me.” Next was to release **possessiveness, **or “that is mine.” And the last involved letting go of **conceit** – the idea that ”I’m better than you,” or “I matter more than you.”

When we detach from the sense of self, we start to look at the world from the perspective of “we” – that is, ourselves and those around us – rather than “I.” We can do this by following practices for **opening into allness **– which is the sixth step on the path to awakening. 

Just like the practice for wholeness, we can use meditation to help us connect** **with the wider world.

Whenever you’re meditating, practice being attentive to how the sense of I or me comes or goes throughout your body. Recognize that this sense of self has many different parts that keep changing due to many factors. And try to imagine your **self **as being cloudlike and insubstantial. Remember the image of the deflating balloon we mentioned in letting go of negativity? Try to imagine the same thing happening to your **self. **

Practices of opening into allness can also include things like venturing into nature. Simply standing in an empty field can help you turn your focus from yourself to the big, wide universe around you.

# Finding Nibbana, or true happiness, means accepting impermanence. 

The author was once talking with the teacher Steve Armstrong, who had trained as a monk in Asia. He was curious to learn more about **nibbana** – the ultimate spiritual goal in Buddhism. 

Nibbana is sublime happiness and liberation from suffering, and the author wanted to know what it felt like to reach that point. 

Steve Armstrong replied that nibbana is like living in a deep valley enclosed by mountains. Then, one day, you’re standing on top of the highest peak – able to see the world in its entirety.

Unfortunately, you can’t stay there; at some point, you have to come back down to the valley. But you’re forever changed by what you’ve seen. 

**Here’s the key message: Finding Nibbana, or true happiness, means accepting impermanence. **

**Finding timelessness** is the last step on the path to finding nibbana – and it’s probably the hardest step.

Being happy and mostly free from suffering involves recognizing that everything is impermanent – just like an **eddy**, a temporary current in water that causes brief ripples. 

By definition, an eddy is a patterning of something that’s stable for a short time before it disperses. For example, a cloud is an eddy of the atmosphere, and an argument is an eddy in a relationship. All eddies eventually disperse.

Finding timelessness means letting go of past pain and experience, and of worry about the future. And the following meditation can help with this.

As always, sit in a comfortable position and rest in your body. Be aware of your breath, as well as any thoughts and sensations that may emerge. Then, focus on an experience you’ve had, or may have in the future, and allow it to change in your consciousness. 

Recognize the different patterns of experience moving through your awareness – just like an eddy in a river. Allow your thoughts to swirl along, looping in and out. 

Be aware of the nature of these eddies of experience: they are impermanent and empty of essence. 

As you do this, try to accept that your nature as a human being is to be an **open process. **Things will change, come apart, and pass away – just let life carry you along. 

Finding nibbana is the equivalent of experiencing a full awakening – and many of us may never get there. However, simply practicing **steadiness, lovingness, fullness, wholeness, nowness, allness, **and** timelessness **in your everyday life can set you on the right track.

# Final summary

The key message in these blinks:

**The seven ways of being provide a roadmap for how to live your life more happily and peacefully. They can help you handle stress, heal past pain, and be more loving and compassionate to yourself and others. Meditation is a powerful tool that can help you develop these ways of being. And practicing regularly can lead to neurological changes, improve your psychological health, and help you learn to live in the here and now. **

Actionable advice: 

**Enjoy the journey.**

Achieving true happiness is no small feat. There will be many bumps in the road, and times when you may want to give up altogether. The important thing is simply to keep going. While you may never reach the top of the mountain of true awakening, embarking on the journey is the most important thing.
