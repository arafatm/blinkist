# A Brief History of Thought

![A Brief History of Thought](https://images.blinkist.com/images/books/5d47ecf66cee07000859eb3f/3_4/470.jpg)

## Final summary

There are roughly five defining stages in the history of Western thought: 
- Greek philosophy, 
- Christianity, 
- humanism, 
- postmodernism and 
- contemporary philosophy.  

Each represented a radical departure from the tenets of its predecessors,
holding different ideas in all three of the main stages of philosophy: theory,
ethics and salvation. 

Contemporary humanism, though, today makes a case for relevance by offering an
attractive fusion of classical humanism with the insights of postmodernism.

## What’s in it for me? Learn about the twists and turns of Western philosophy through the ages.

For anyone starting out with philosophy, it’s easy to get disheartened.
Incomprehensible jargon, long-winded sentences and a jumble of abstract ideas
often obscure precious insights into what it means to be human and how we
should live our lives – like trying to admire a beautiful view through a dirty
window. 

But these blinks offer you a sure and simple path through that morass, taking
Western thought’s most complex and vital ideas and distilling them into
language that everyone can understand. Starting with ancient Greek conceptions
of the universe and finishing with the rise of contemporary humanism, you will
learn about all the major phases in Western philosophy’s development.

More than that, these blinks will show you how different philosophical schools
have applied their wisdom concretely, enabling adherents to overcome their fear
of death and live happier, more content and more meaningful lives.

In these blinks, you’ll find out
- how philosophy and religion are similar;
- why Christianity supplanted Greek philosophy; and
- how Friedrich Nietzsche ushered in a new age of thinking.

## Philosophy has three primary dimensions.

To outline the history of philosophy, we must understand what it is – how it
works, and what it seeks to achieve. 

So, what is philosophy?

Unfortunately, there’s no universally accepted definition – philosophers are a
notoriously opinionated and argumentative group. But we can arrive at a
satisfactory description with a bit of thought.

To begin with, humans are, in philosophical language, **finite beings**: mortal
creatures occupying a limited patch of space and time. And, unlike other
animals, we’re aware of these limits. A dog or lion, for instance, has no
advance knowledge of their death. They’re only concerned with the present
moment. But humans live knowing that they – and their loved ones – will
inevitably die. 

This shadow of death forces us to contemplate what to do with our fleeting time
on Earth. It also instills us with deep terror – fear of losing loved ones,
fear of the unknown, fear of nothingness.

This angst prevents us from living a wholly contented life, full of love and
satisfaction. And from the start, philosophy and religion have tried to help us
conquer this fear – but they go about it in entirely different ways.

Religion – and particularly Christianity – promises to save us from the fear of
death through **faith**. If we have faith in God, He will save us by admitting
us into heaven, where we’ll reunite with our loved ones for eternity.

Philosophy, on the other hand, promises to save us by using our own logic and
reasoning. By trying to understand ourselves, other people and the world we
inhabit, philosophy hopes to conquer the anxiety surrounding death.

Toward this end, philosophical thinking comprises three stages.

First is theory. This involves thinking deeply about the nature of reality. But
our knowledge of reality is filtered through the tools we use to comprehend it,
and so theory studies those tools too. How do we pinpoint the causes of natural
phenomena? What are the ways through which we can establish a statement as
“true?” These questions make up the second part of theory.

Second is ethics. This is more practical and studies humanity. In particular,
it asks how we should behave and coexist with one another. 

Third is wisdom or salvation. This is the ultimate goal of religion and
philosophy and asks what – if any – meaning there is to life, and how we can
live a fulfilled life free from the suffocating fear of our mortality.

And one of the first philosophies to utilize this three-stage system was
Stoicism.

## Stoicism attempted to explain the functioning of the universe and humankind’s place within it.

One of the most influential philosophical movements in ancient Greece was
**Stoicism, **founded by Zeno of Citium in the third century BC. To outline it,
we’ll follow the three stages of philosophy outlined in the previous blink:
theory, ethics and salvation.

According to the Stoics, the universe was similar to an animal. Each part of it
was like an organ: specifically created to play a small role in helping the
whole body to function. The result, they thought, was a perfectly harmonious,
pre-ordained natural order between each part of the universe. They thought this
order formed the fundamental nature, or **essence**, of reality, which they
called **kosmos**. For the Stoics, this order existed within the universe and
not external to it, like the God of Judaism, Christianity and Islam.

To see an example of this order from the Stoics’ perspective, consider the
human body and our natural environment. The body and our environment, the
Stoics would say, are perfectly designed to provide us with everything we need;
we have eyes and legs to see the world and move around in it, intelligence to
overcome obstacles and natural resources to feed, clothe and shelter us. 

And because this natural order is already perfect, humankind’s ultimate goal is
simply to find their rightful place within it. This leads us to the question of
ethics.

From the Stoic perspective, ethics was fairly straightforward. That is,
whatever went against the cosmic order was wrong and bad, and whatever acted in
harmony with it was right and good. To be an ethical person, in turn, you had
to act in accordance with the order of things and fulfill the duties of your
assigned place – whatever that order or place might be. Of course, from a
modern perspective, this idea has some troubling social and political
implications. For example, according to the Stoics, if you were born a slave,
this was your rightful place in the cosmic order, and your task was to accept
it.

The Stoics also had their own version of salvation. By contemplating the
natural order of the universe and living harmoniously within it, they hoped to
understand that death didn’t truly exist – at least not in the sense of it
being a final ending. Instead, they believed that when we die, we’re really
just transported from one state of being to the next within the natural order.
That order, in turn, is eternal, and we’re carried on as part of it after
death. So, rather than an ending, death is just a waypoint in our journey
through the cosmos.

## Christianity supplanted Greek philosophy and revolutionized human thinking.

Although Christianity isn’t a philosophy because it emphasizes faith over
reason, it’s still a system of thought that displaced Greek philosophy and had
an immeasurable impact on the course of history.

How did this come about? Let’s again follow it through the stages of theory,
ethics and salvation.

Firstly, Christian theory shifted **logos **– universal, unquestionable logic
and reason – away from the structure of the universe. Instead, logos was
embodied in an individual: Jesus Christ. This was a radical change. Suddenly,
logos wasn’t found in a cold and detached structure, but in one single,
extraordinary individual.

And remember, theory also looks at the tools we use to understand reality. Here
again, Christianity revolutionized thinking. To understand the true nature of
things, it argued, faith was required, not reason. Christians must place their
faith in Jesus, the center of logos, who speaks for the supreme creator.

Christianity uprooted ideas about ethics in three ways, beginning with a
rejection of the Greek notion of a natural hierarchy. According to this notion,
nature unequally gifts us things like beauty, strength and height. To the
Greeks, this unequal distribution of gifts provides proof that some of us are
born to lead and others to follow.

But Christianity insisted that these inequalities were insignificant. What
mattered instead were the decisions we made with what we’d been given.
Therefore, we all had the freedom to choose how to live, and these choices
determined how good and virtuous our lives were. 

This notion of freedom of choice was the first innovation that Christianity
brought to Western ethics. This led to Christianity’s second innovative idea:
that our inner spiritual world was more important than the external world of
nature. This is why, during the early days of Christianity, martyrs were happy
to be executed for their faith; in their minds, the outer realm of man was
inferior to the inner realm of God.

The third ethical innovation was the modern idea of humanity. Because logos was
now personalized in the form of Christ and the Christian religion maintained
that everyone was an equal “creature of God,” it became easy to think about a
universally equal human race.

Finally, the Christian doctrine of salvation was also new. Christianity
promised its believers a personal form of eternity – individual immortality in
the Kingdom of Heaven. It allowed Christians to conquer their fear of death by
believing that, after death, they will keep their individual personalities and
consciousnesses and be reunited with their loved ones.

## The scientific revolution unleashed systems of thought that led to modern philosophy.

In the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, humankind blew apart its previous
conceptions of reality. For example, in the models of the universe developed by
astronomers and mathematicians like Nicolaus Copernicus, the cosmos was an
infinite void, with Earth definitely not at its center. Meanwhile, in the wake
of theories developed by physicists like Isaac Newton, people understood the
universe to be governed by forces that could be precisely measured and
calculated.

It’s hard to comprehend the chasm of fear this would’ve opened for people at
this time. Now that the universe seemed to be infinite and coldly mechanical,
humans needed a new ethical order and way in which to interpret their place
within the world. Also, with the afterlife now revealed to be a fiction for
some, they needed a new form of salvation.

And by ushering in modern philosophy, the French philosopher Descartes helped
people to achieve these goals.

Descartes took the doubt unleashed by the scientific revolution and molded it
into a tool for philosophical inquiry. In a search for irrefutable truth,
Descartes examined reality by adopting a position of radical skepticism and
critical thinking. In doing so, he invented an attitude crucial to modern
philosophy: the **critical spirit**. And, to examine reality, Descartes used
the idea of **tabula rasa **– a clean slate. He would reject all prior beliefs
and assumptions and start his inquiries afresh.

In the wake of these significant innovations came Jean-Jacques Rousseau – a
hugely important philosopher and the founder of modern humanism. Rousseau
placed human beings at the very center of his conception of the world. He
thought that by understanding ourselves, we could understand the world in which
we live.

And Rousseau didn’t view humans as just another animal – he thought that what
made us different was our **perfectibility**.

According to Rousseau, animals operate within predictable patterns of behavior,
programmed by nature. That’s why cats will not eat grass, and why giraffes
won’t eat meat. But humans, on the other hand, possess a large capacity to
change and perfect themselves over their lives. We can choose to be vegetarian,
for example, or create our own, unique personal history.

But humanists also need a version of salvation.

To achieve this, some turned to **religions of earthly salvation **–
pseudo-religions centered on human beings, rather than god(s). Things like
communism, scientism and patriotism are all religions of earthly salvation,
promising us utopias. To their adherents, they give meaning to human existence
by providing objectives that are supposedly more important than a single
individual’s life.

## Immanuel Kant took up Rousseau's humanism and applied it to ethics.

Rousseau’s radical new way of thinking about human freedom provoked a question
that paved the way for new ideas about ethics. The question was this: With so
much freedom available to them, how could human beings structure their behavior
according to clear ethical guidelines?

The German philosopher Immanuel Kant took up this question in the eighteenth
century, developing a theory of ethics for a new world in which humans were
considered free actors. He came to two conclusions that would dramatically
impact modern thought and become the basis of modern humanism.

First, he claimed that good ethical conduct depends on disinterested actions –
that is, behavior that is not driven by personal and selfish motives.

Humans, like all other animals, are born with a set of natural urges that drive
us to satisfy our desires. But, unlike other animals, we can ignore these
impulses. In this way, we can be **disinterested **in our personal gain.

For Kant, a truly ethical – a truly **human** – action requires us to ignore
our egotistical impulses and adopt an attitude of disinterestedness. We need to
work toward this in our everyday life – and choose to do so freely. If we are
forced to act, the ethical aspect of the action is invalidated.

Second, Kant insisted that an ethical action is one directed toward a
universal, common good. 

This means that good, ethical behavior is that which isn’t linked to the
interests of your family or nation, but to a shared humanity.

By directing our actions toward a common good, we use our freedom of choice to
make disinterested decisions that benefit the welfare of humanity. In doing
this, we distance ourselves from our primitive, egotistical impulses and become
closer to humanity as a whole.

In Kant’s conception of ethics, unlike that of the Stoics, we no longer try to
conform to the “natural” order of things in our actions – indeed, by overriding
our natural desires, we try to oppose it. Kant called this duty to humanity
over nature a **categorical imperative**, that is, an unquestionable
commandment.

The need for such a commandment comes from the fact that we’re trying to resist
our natural impulses. After all, if we were naturally programmed to place
humanity before ourselves, we wouldn’t need to be told to do so!

These ideas formed the foundation of modern humanism – a foundation that would
be shattered by Friedrich Nietzsche in the eighteenth century.

## Friedrich Nietzsche dismantled humanism and ushered in the age of postmodern philosophy.

So far, we’ve seen several watershed moments in the development of Western
thought. But we can’t speak of philosophical revolutions without mentioning the
German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche.

We can read Nietzsche’s philosophy as a crusade against what he called
**nihilism. **For Nietzsche, all doctrines – from Christianity and humanism to
socialism – suppose that there’s a better world to be had and that we should
sideline the present moment in favor of striving for it. They all had utopias
to work toward and things they valued more than everyday life, like God and
humanity. Nietzsche saw these as destroying and denying the importance and
value of life as it is. Nihilism was, for Nietzsche, a denial of life.  

Nietzsche spent his life trying to expose the futility of nihilism. To that
end, his philosophy insists that there are no utopias or values that give
meaning to life. Instead, the meaning of life is life itself! In other words,
life doesn’t depend on something else – something superior to it – to give it
meaning; rather, life gives meaning to itself. 

Also, Nietzsche saw the world as comprising of two different forces: reactive
and active. What’s more, these forces were chaotic and always in conflict – the
world could never be reduced to the Greek ideas of harmony.

Reactive forces function only by denying and repressing other forces. By
claiming to represent ideal truths that are superior to humans, religion,
science and modern philosophy all react against ordinary human life. In other
words, to function effectively, these thought systems devalued our everyday
realities. The same is true for pity, regret and doubt – these emotions thrived
by demeaning life, that is, by reacting against it.

But active forces don’t need to repress other forces. Art is the natural home
for active forces because it opens up new perspectives without needing to prove
its predecessors wrong. While one can say that communism is right and racism is
wrong, one couldn’t seriously say that Picasso was correct and Monet was
incorrect. 

But Nietzsche didn’t argue that we must eliminate reactive forces in favor of
active forces – instead, he held that we must strive to balance these two types
of forces. When we do, life becomes more vivid and vibrant. Nietzsche called
the active desire to achieve a perfect balance of forces the **will to power.**

If we can teach our active and reactive forces to cooperate, we live life
intensely and fully – no longer torn apart by our reactive forces of regret and
self-doubt. Nietzsche called the attainment of this **the grand style **– his
version of salvation.

Because of his readiness to forge a new philosophical path – away from the
tenets of modern humanism – Nietzsche can be seen as the founder of
**postmodern **thinking. But in time, even this great philosopher’s ideas would
be called into question.

## Contemporary humanism offers a way past the cynicism of postmodernism.

One criticism leveled against Nietzsche is the following: If we’re constantly
trying to deconstruct all our values and thought systems and if we maintain
that there’s nothing superior to the here and now, where are we headed? The
postmodern thinking Nietzsche helped usher in risks putting the real and
concrete world on a pedestal and worshipping it.

But there’s another path. We can take the insights gained from postmodernism
and use them to rethink humanism. This is **contemporary humanism**.

In the light of the wisdom of postmodernism, contemporary humanism rejects the
religions of earthly salvation common to the classical humanists. But it
doesn’t agree with Nietzsche’s assertion that only the real world of experience
exists. Instead, it poses that some things are **transcendent** – external and
superior to ourselves.

To prove this, the German philosopher Edmund Husserl used a simple analogy
involving a matchbox.

We know a matchbox has six sides, but when we hold it up to our eyes, no matter
how we hold it, we can only ever see three sides at once. This is also true for
reality, in that whichever angle we view life from, there are sides to it we
can’t see at the moment, some of which are transcendental. The presence of
something always implies an absence of something else – however we contemplate
reality, we can never totally grasp it.

In this way, transcendence isn’t an abstract ideal like in classical humanism –
it becomes a proven fact, a very part of the reality in which we live. We can
call this **transcendence here-and-now**.

By admitting this, we also admit that human knowledge is limited and cannot be
omniscient. This also breaks with classical humanism by rejecting “absolute
knowledge” and naive faith in human science.

We can see transcendence more concretely in things like truth and beauty.
Humans cannot invent the truth that 1 + 1 = 2; likewise, a painter doesn’t
invent the beauty contained in her artwork.

Contemporary humanism offers different ethics, too.

Nietzsche taught us to reject all values supposedly superior to life. This is
something that has influenced today’s Western democracies – there are now few
who would sacrifice their lives for God or a communist government.

Contemporary humanism does have values, but these values center on life itself.
These new transcendent values are not vertical, like patriotism, but
horizontal. Contemporary humanists take a collective view of humanity, and
their values center upon their fellow human beings, not abstract ideas
“superior” to them.

Unfortunately, contemporary humanism can’t offer a Christian kind of salvation
where the fear of death is removed. Instead, it can harness this fear, using it
to determine what we need to do in the present moment for humanity as a whole.
