## Final summary

Ancient Egypt’s divine kingship was a unique patriarchal power system that
repeatedly allowed women to take the throne. Egypt’s most famous female leaders
– Merneith, Neferusobek, Hatshepsut, Nefertiti, Tawosret and Cleopatra – used
their distinct leadership skills to keep their country safe in times of crisis.
Though their male successors often tried to erase their legacies, their stories
live on, reminding us of the value of female leadership today.

## What’s in it for me? Learn the history of Egypt’s female leaders.

Shrill, bossy, selfish – these are terms you may have heard used to describe
women in power. In fact, many sociological studies show a bias against women as
leaders that prevails even in our ostensibly progressive society. Hillary
Clinton’s 2016 election campaign was, for many women, a particularly painful
reminder of the opposition to female leadership that still exists in the modern
world.

So it may come as a surprise that in ancient Egypt, a culture preceding ours by
thousands of years, women were consistently called upon to lead the country.
Royal women repeatedly stepped forward to claim the throne, from the first
ruling dynasty of the Egyptian nation-state to the very last. How could women
gain and hold so much power in a deeply patriarchal, ancient society? 

Using the latest archeological evidence, Egyptologist Kara Cooney traces the
stories of six of these women – Merneith, Neferusobek, Hatshepsut, Nefertiti,
Tawosret and Cleopatra – through the rise and fall of the Egyptian empire. Take
a deep dive into ancient history and discover how these female trailblazers
kept their country prosperous and safe – and find out what lessons the lives of
these powerful women hold for us today.

In these blinks, you will learn about 
- the lives, losses and successes of Egypt’s six most important female leaders;
- the mechanisms of power in ancient Egypt; and
- the value of female leadership in times of crisis.

## In times of crisis, ancient Egypt repeatedly called upon women to lead the country.

Thousands of years ago, in ancient Egypt, women ruled supreme. How was this
possible? To answer this question, we need to take a look at Egypt’s unique
system of power: divine kingship.

In 3000 BC, when northern Egypt defeated the south after centuries of conflict,
the Egyptian nation-state was established. Protected by deserts and seas, rich
in minerals and nourished by the Nile, Egypt became one of the most prosperous
nations in the ancient world. This wealth may be the reason for Egypt’s
relative political stability throughout the millennia.

At the same time that the nation was established, Egypt’s tradition of divine
kingship was founded with Dynasty 1, the first of 20 royal dynasties. For the
Egyptians, their king was a divine representative with incontestable authority
– even when “he” was a woman.

Make no mistake: ancient Egypt’s regency system was undeniably patriarchal and
authoritarian. Power was meant to transfer from father to son indefinitely, and
female rule was an exception. This belief was rooted in the myth of the god
Osiris, the primeval king of Egypt, who had passed his title on to his son
Horus.

However, Egyptian mythology also has a representative of the divine feminine in
the form of Osiris’s wife and sister, Isis. In texts inscribed on pyramid
walls, the goddess Isis is portrayed as queen, mother, lover, daughter and
nurturer. The titles of royal women, such as Great Royal Wife or King’s Mother,
were modeled after these female archetypes. Their job was to protect the
kingship, making sure the royal lineage could continue uninterrupted.

Trying to produce male offspring was considered a royal duty and, to maximize
the king’s chances of reproduction, he had multiple wives. But despite this
practice of polygamy, ancient Egypt faced no shortage of succession crises.
Each time a royal family line ended, a new dynasty would arise. 

It was often during the uncertain times at the ending of a dynasty that a woman
stepped up to take power. Women often pulled strings from behind the scenes,
making it even harder to trace their achievements. When a king was crowned too
young, his mother would act as regent – as done by Egypt’s first female leader,
Queen Merneith.

Though these female rulers often had short reigns as strategic peacekeepers,
some of them accomplished as much as any male counterpart. But all too often,
their names have been erased and forgotten.

## Queen Merneith ruled in her son’s stead, cementing power in ritual sacrifice.

What do you do when your country’s new king is only two years old? You let his
mother call the shots. That’s how Queen Merneith of Dynasty 1 came to rule
Egypt. We know about her story from inscriptions in royal burial complexes,
temples and monuments. The Palermo Stone, a famous fragment of a royal
monument, lists her as King’s Mother – right alongside the male kings of
Dynasty 1 through 5.

Young Merneith was no stranger to power. As the daughter of the revered King
Djer, she grew up in the royal palace in Memphis and observed the king’s duties
up close. When her father died, Merneith’s brother Djet took the throne and
asked her to be his wife. You read that right: Merneith was now both the King’s
sister and his wife.

When Djet unexpectedly died a few years into his reign, his son Den was still a
toddler – too young to rule on his own. And so his mother Merneith ruled in his
stead. As queen regent, her first duty was to arrange the burial of her
husband. During Dynasty 1, a king’s burial was a gruesome affair, accompanied
by the human sacrifice of wives, servants and friends. For the burial of
Merneith’s father Djer, 587 people were killed in the city of Abydos alone. But
these sacrificial burials were not merely religious theatrics – they were also
a useful tool to cull power-hungry relatives in the tender period after a
king’s death, ensuring a smooth transition of power from father to son.

Merneith employed this strategy as cleverly as any of her male predecessors.
Near where King Djet is buried lie the graves of many high-ranking men, women
and children – probably Den’s half-brothers from the harem. It seems that
Merneith made sure to rid her son of any potential challengers.

Having forged her authority in death, blood and sacrifice, Merneith ruled for
her son for six or seven years, until he was old enough to do so himself. It
seems that she groomed him well, with King Den’s many military successes
recorded in the Palermo Stone.

Merneith, who died at around the age of 50, was honored with a king’s burial.
The skeletons of 120 close allies lie near her tomb at the royal necropolis of
Abydos. Despite that, Merneith never officially took the title of king. A queen
named Neferusobek would shatter this glass ceiling.

## Neferusobek became the first female king of Egypt – stalling a succession crisis caused by inbreeding.

As we’ve seen, incest wasn’t taboo for the ancient Egyptians. In fact, not only
was incest a regular occurrence in the royal palace, but Egyptian royalty
considered it the ideal strategy for reproduction – just as it did for
patrilineal succession. After all, the myth of Isis and Osiris served as
inspiration – a union that produced Osiris’s heir Horus.

And incest was a great way to “keep it in the family” when it came to royal
power. Instead of marrying in another elite group who would suddenly want a
bigger piece of the pie, wealth and power stayed within a close-knit family
circuit.

But inbreeding could be costly, which is evident in the numerous ailments and
deformities from which the Egyptian kings suffered. It’s well known that
Tutankhamun of Dynasty 18 had a club foot, possibly from cerebral palsy. 

And there was another hidden cost to inbreeding, one that defeated the whole
purpose of the practice: sterility. The kingship suffered no shortage of
succession crises because a king couldn’t produce offspring. It was during one
of these crises that Neferusobek rose to power.

Neferusobek was a King’s Daughter, born toward the end of her father Amenemhat
III’s long and prosperous reign. And like Merneith, she was married to her
brother Amenemhat IV, the new king, when her father died. But Amenemhat IV was
himself the result of an incestuous union – and sterile because of it. He left
no heirs when he died after his nine-year reign.

Because a royal succession crisis seemed to pose a greater threat to social
stability than a female king, Neferusobek was allowed to take the throne. Her
job would be to keep the country stable until it had an heir.

As the first woman to officially claim the title of King, Neferusobek was
determined to legitimize her reign. To prove her piety, she completed
construction of a temple complex in Hawara begun by her father, and also
created new places of worship that highlighted her royal lineage.

Unfortunately for Neferusobek, the country she inherited was plagued by
droughts and hunger, spurring social unrest. In the palace, elites schemed
against her in a secret battle for the throne. Then, after just four years of
rule, Neferusobek mysteriously died, her dynasty going with her. It would take
another 500 years for a woman to claim the kingship once more.

## Ruling Egypt for over two decades, Hatshepsut was the most influential female king of all.

A few centuries after Neferusobek’s dynasty was brought to its knees by the
effects of inbreeding, Dynasty 18, led by warrior King Thutmose I, expanded
Egypt’s borders into the Levant, crushing the mineral-rich provinces of Nubia
and Kush.

Luckily, Thutmose I’s eldest daughter Hatshepsut, whom he appointed to the
prominent office of High Priestess when she was just a girl, inherited her
father’s determination and leadership skills. When Thutmose I died, Hatshepsut
became the Great Royal Wife of her sickly brother Thutmose II. The new king
Thutmose II accomplished little and died after only a few years of rule. A
toddler born of his harem was then selected to be the next king. But Thutmose
III’s biological mother was incapacitated, so Hatshepsut was chosen to rule in
the boy’s stead.

Egypt’s elites appear to have grown even more prosperous under Hatshepsut’s
reign, with archeologists reporting a material explosion of statues, reliefs
and luxury goods for the period following her accession. This prosperity
suggests that Hatshepsut may have acted as a power broker, doling out wealth
and influence to elites in return for their support.

To convince the rest of the population of her authority, Hatshepsut
aggressively promoted her rule as divine will by erecting great works such as
the Temple of Millions of Years near Thebes, on whose walls she is depicted
interacting with the gods. And in a well-curated public celebration, the great
oracle of the god Amun, located at the Temple of Amun in Siwa, revealed her as
the newly chosen leader of Egypt. When Thutmose III was around nine, she
officially crowned herself co-king beside him.

Like her father, Hatshepsut led military campaigns into Nubia and Kush. She
expanded Egypt’s borders, enriched elites, built temples and promoted risky but
rewarding trading ventures. But like those of so many women, her achievements
were co-opted by the men who succeeded her. After she died at around 50 years
old, her nephew and former co-king Thutmose III began erasing all imagery and
mention of her. But evidence of Hatshepsut’s rule – like the great Temple of
Millions of Years – remains throughout Egypt.

## Reinventing herself as a man, Nefertiti rose to power during a religious crisis caused by her husband.

Every year, half a million visitors flock to see the bust of Nefertiti at the
Egyptian Museum of Berlin. The mysterious queen is revered for her beauty – but
recent evidence suggests Nefertiti was more than just a pretty face.

King Amenhotep IV of Dynasty 18 took Nefertiti as his Great Royal Wife when she
was perhaps only ten years old. He had inherited a peaceful and prosperous
Egypt, whose people bowed eagerly to the will of their divine king. Little did
they know that Amenhotep’s maniacal religious agenda would throw the country
into disarray.

His unorthodox beliefs began to show in Year 5 of his reign, when Amenhotep
ordered a sed festival, a celebration usually reserved for the 30th year of a
king’s reign, and dedicated it to the minor sun god Aten. This threw the normal
hierarchy of Egypt’s polytheism out the window.

Attempting to establish a radical new religion of light, Amenhotep changed his
name to Akhenaten, meaning “beneficial to Aten,” and started building new
temples. He also defunded the old temples and left behind the old court cities
Heliopolis, Memphis and Thebes to erect a new capital city in the middle of the
country. He bribed elite families into joining him there and dragged along
craftsmen and workers, hundreds of whom died during the city’s rapid
construction. 

Until recently, historians believed that Nefertiti died in Year 12 of
Akhenaten’s reign when her name is erased from the inscriptions. But she didn’t
actually die – she just reinvented herself as Akhenaten’s new male co-king,
Ankhkheperure Neferneferuaten.

When Akhenaten died after 17 years of rule, Neferneferuaten disappeared, and a
certain Ankhkheperure Smenkhkare took the throne. It was likely none other than
Nefertiti, reinventing herself once again. In one image, this new king is
depicted with a feminine garment under his masculine kilt.

As Smenkhkare, Nefertiti attempted to restore the country that her husband had
bankrupted with his radical endeavors. Her first order was to abandon the city
of Akhetaten and return to Memphis, where she reinstalled the cult statues of
the old gods. Before she died, she began preparing the next king,
eight-year-old Tutankhamun, whose famous gold tomb was found by Egyptologist
Howard Carter in 1922. Contemporary archeologists even have evidence that this
tomb is just the entrance hall to a much bigger, more opulent grave: that of
Nefertiti.

## Tawosret took the throne by force, becoming the first woman to rule Egypt unaccompanied.

Hatshepsut’s enrichment of the elites and Akhenaten’s religious fanaticism led
to permanent shifts in Egypt’s balance of power. In Dynasties 19 and 20,
politics became more decentralized and the kingship opened up, allowing other
families to marry into royalty. This meant less royal inbreeding and more
competition among elite families. At the same time, Egyptians tried to curtail
female authority, removing previous women leaders from the king’s lists and
making sure that no woman held multiple royal titles.

This systematic suppression was the reason why Queen Tawosret had to use
unorthodox measures to gain power. Tawosret was born in an internationalized
Egypt, where mass migration and foreign influence led to an explosion of
complexity in social and political relations. At around 2000 BC, she became the
wife of King Seti II, who had just ascended to the throne. There was only one
problem: in Lower Egypt, a Theben man named Amunmesses claimed to be king as
well. Thanks to superior military resources, Seti II proved victorious in the
civil war that ensued.

To consolidate his victory in the South, Seti sent an officer named Bay to
Thebes. But Bay seemed much more interested in amassing his own power,
commissioning monuments that depicted him as tall and impressive, like a king
himself. When Seti II unexpectedly died, Bay already had a plan in place. He
installed the new King Siptah, a weak child with cerebral palsy, and his
maternal regent Tawosret, to use them as pawns in his own power game.

But it seems Tawosret had a plan of her own – in Year 5 of Siptah’s reign, Bay
disappeared. An inscription found at a former workmen’s village hints at the
murder of the “great enemy Bay,” likely at the hands of Tawosret. Two years
later, 16-year-old King Siptah also died. Tawosret crowned herself King,
becoming the first woman to rule Egypt unaccompanied – and likely the first
woman to seize power by strategically murdering her rivals.

But Tawosret’s reign was short-lived. Between just two and four years into her
reign, she met an untimely end at the hands of Setnakht, a warlord who became
the founder of Dynasty 20. The author speculates that Tawosret was punished for
her male ambition, or simply regarded as illegitimate for her lack of royal
blood. Whatever the reason, she was the last female ruler from an Egyptian
dynasty – but she wasn’t the last woman to rule Egypt.

## Cleopatra was a master tactician and used her relationships with Roman politicians to build Egypt’s power.

Egypt’s last queen is undoubtedly its most famous, although she wasn’t actually
Egyptian. Cleopatra was a member of the Ptolemaic Dynasty, a Greek-Macedonian
family that inherited Egypt after it was freed from Persian rule in 332 BC. The
Ptolemies embraced Egypt’s system of divine kingship, combining it with the
hypercompetitive political system of the Greeks. As a result, conspiracy and
murder were rife.

At 14, Cleopatra was named co-ruler of Egypt by her father Ptolemy XII. When he
died, he named his son Ptolemy XIII as successor. But Ptolemy XII didn’t want
to share the throne with his sister, driving Cleopatra into exile in Syria
shortly after his accession.

Ptolemy XIII soon had problems of his own after allying himself with the
rebellious Roman leader Pompey. When Pompey lost the Roman civil war to Julius
Caesar, Ptolemy faced Caesar’s wrath.

Cleopatra heard of her brother’s plight, arranging a secret meeting with Caesar
when he visited Alexandria. Charmed by her wit, Caesar pressured Ptolemy XIII
to reinstate Cleopatra as co-ruler.

But Ptolemy XIII fought back. Allied against the king, Cleopatra and Caesar
mobilized support from Syria and other allies to defeat him. After their
victory, Cleopatra took the throne alongside her younger brother, Ptolemy XIV,
and brought Caesar to live with her in the palace. Soon after, she became
pregnant with his child, which she knew would give her valuable political
leverage against Rome.

But Cleopatra and Caesar’s relationship caused outrage in Rome and, soon after
leaving Egypt, Caesar was killed by his fellow senators. Left with no allies,
Cleopatra immediately set about consolidating her power in Egypt, poisoning her
brother and positioning her young son Caesarion as co-ruler in his place. She
also sought new ties in Rome, allying herself with Caesar’s former ally Marc
Antony.

It seemed like a promising alliance at first – Cleopatra and Antony supported
each other in matters of state and they soon became close. Eventually,
Cleopatra bore Antony children, promising to cement an Egyptian-Roman dynasty.

But the Romans became unhappy with Antony’s capitulations to Egypt, combined
with the return of Egyptian territories Rome had captured. When Antony’s forces
suffered a major military loss, the Romans decided they’d had enough and
declared war on Egypt.

Though Cleopatra and Antony tried to hold their own in battle, it soon became
clear that the Roman army could not be beaten. When the last of his men
defected, Anthony stabbed himself in the stomach. The Romans seized Alexandria,
killing Cleopatra’s son Caesarion and taking her younger children hostage.
Cleopatra, recognizing that her scheme had proved fruitless, poisoned herself
in a bathtub.

## Just as the Egyptians did millennia before us, we should learn to embrace female leadership.

Like many successful women, Cleopatra was relentlessly mocked by the men whose
very power she threatened. The Romans ridiculed her for her excessive displays
of wealth and emotional outbursts. Octavian accused her of being selfish,
sexually manipulating Marc Antony for her own political benefit. She was the
perfect scapegoat to convince the Roman Senate to wage war against one of their
own. And yet Cleopatra is remembered because she nearly had it all.

Selfishness and emotional sensitivity are still common labels attached to women
in power. The author argues that Hillary Clinton’s loss of the 2016
presidential election is a telling example of how women are still held back in
progressive Western society for displaying ambition too openly, while men are
rewarded for it. Moreover, strong leadership and the emotional sensitivity
ascribed to women are often depicted as incompatible. But the ancient Egyptians
understood that a woman’s emotionality, even her supposed indecisiveness, could
be a political advantage in troublesome times.

The names of many of Egypt’s female leaders have been erased, omitted or
forgotten. All too often, they are only remembered for their failures, even
when they were simply a victim of circumstance. Their rule was only permitted
in times of crisis – tolerated when it supported patriarchal succession. But
time and again, the likes of Hatshepsut, Nefertiti and Cleopatra proved that
they could keep their country safe and advance its interests, using a
leadership style distinct from that of their male colleagues.

Associated with empathy, prudence and pragmatism, the “softer” emotional
leadership evident in some of these women’s stories can be a tool for
consensus-building in times of crisis. After all, it has historically been men
– who are usually conditioned to limit their emotional range to things like
anger – making hot-headed decisions that escalate conflicts and lead to war.

In these calamitous political times, we would be wise to recognize the
qualities of female leadership and call upon women to again take charge. The
tales of ancient Egypt’s historical female rulers can serve as a reminder that
a woman in power, though they often have to work extra hard to obtain and hold
their position, can get the job done as well as any man.
