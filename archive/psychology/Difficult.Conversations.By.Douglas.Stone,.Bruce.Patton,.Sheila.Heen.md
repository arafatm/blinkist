## Final summary

Difficult conversations are often avoided because you fear the results. 

The “What Happened?”, Feelings and Identity Conversations can be transformed
into Learning Conversations by focusing on curiosity, sharing feelings and
refraining from blaming each other. 

Keeping these things in mind and telling a Third Story will help you and the
person you’re talking to have a meaningful conversation.

## Actionable advice:

**Pay attention to your inner voice.**

Your inner voice is that little sound in your head that remarks on everything
you hear, do and read. Sometimes that voice can grow in volume and overpower
the voices of others. Instead of muting it, first, listen to it. This way
you’ll discover your true thoughts and train yourself to listen more
attentively to others.

## What’s in it for me? Learn how to become a better communicator.

Some people are great communicators, while others cower at the thought of
discussing difficult topics with another person.

But sometimes there are tough conversations you can’t avoid, and therefore,
it’s important to learn how to handle a difficult conversation. Thankfully, the
authors have compiled tips and everyday examples to help you get better at
unpleasant exchanges.

These blinks highlight the common pitfalls that blight many difficult
conversations. They also provide advice on how to stop them. Finally, the
blinks provide you with a framework to ensure that your conversations around
difficult topics stay on topic and free of hurt.

Afterward, no difficult conversation will scare you away.

In these blinks, you’ll find out
- about the **“What Happened?” Conversation**;
- what an **emotional footprint **is; and
- how to confront a flatmate about dirty dishes.

## You shouldn’t avoid difficult conversations out of fear of the consequences.

Communication is key to getting what you want, but some conversations are
harder to have than others.

A difficult conversation is anything you find a challenge to discuss. Common
topics include race, religion, sexuality and gender politics, but it can extend
to any conversations that make you uncomfortable – such as asking your partner
to quit smoking.

Unpleasant talks are often avoided because the outcomes are unpredictable and
the stakes are high, leaving you vulnerable. Your mind jumps back and forth,
trying to decide the best course of action: Should I approach this issue? Or
should I just let it go? If you choose to confront it, the situation could
improve. However, there’s also the risk that you may get a less than favorable
result.

Say you decide to talk to your neighbor about his dog keeping you up at night
with its incessant barking. On the one hand, he might be very understanding and
offer to keep the dog inside after dark. But he may also think you’re
overreacting and hold a grudge against you for complaining.

No matter the situation, always take up the conversation – even if it’s
difficult.

Difficult conversations aren’t ideal, but neither are barking dogs keeping you
up at night. More often than not, these talks are worth the effort if there’s a
chance they could improve your life. So don’t turn a blind eye – or a deaf ear
– to something that’s bugging you. Instead, learn how to speak up in an
effective manner, which we’ll teach you in the following blinks.

## Difficult conversations comprise of blame, feelings and identity.

Any difficult discussion consists of three elements happening at the same time:
- the **“What Happened?” Conversation**, 
- the **Feelings Conversation** and
- the **Identity Conversation.**

The **“What Happened?”** Conversation involves fighting over who’s right, assuming
the other person’s intentions and assigning blame.

In a battle over who’s right, each party believes that they’re correct while
their opposition is wrong. You could make a claim such as “What you said the
other night was totally inappropriate,” but the other person may well be able
to say the same thing to you!

In addition to asserting that you’re right, it’s easy to slip into accusations
of ill intent. Say your partner flushed your cigarettes down the toilet.
Instead of the more likely scenario that they did this to help you quit, you
accuse them of being malicious, arguing that “You threw away my cigarettes
because you want to control me!”

We may also end up blaming the other person for things they had nothing to do
with: “It’s your fault that I was late to work today because I had to stop by
the shop to pick up a new packet of cigarettes.”

Next is the **Feelings Conversation**, which is all about emotions.

Conversations are difficult because they involve emotions. Often those are
disappointment, anger, frustration, fear and hurt. Perhaps you feel
disrespected by a colleague, or they feel hurt because you said or did
something insensitive.

The third type is the **Identity Conversation**, and that’s about our
character.

Remember the scenario with the neighbor’s dog? You’ve decided you want to
confront your neighbor, but just the idea of it makes you uneasy because you
consider yourself a friendly person. If you bring up the issue with your
neighbor, they might brand you as aggressive – challenging your self-image.
Since such an imbalance leads to self-doubt, you may avoid confronting the
problem to keep your image intact.

Now that we’ve identified the components of a difficult conversation, we know
which areas need improving. The next blinks will explain exactly how to turn
any difficult conversation into a **Learning Conversation.**

## Turn the “What Happened” Conversation into a Learning Conversation by focusing on curiosity, impact and contribution.

A **Learning Conversation **is a discussion in which we try to work something
out without fighting, blaming, silencing our emotions or doubting ourselves.

Let’s apply the Learning Conversation approach to the three types of difficult
conversations mentioned earlier, starting with the “What Happened?”
Conversation.

First, try to figure out where your opponent is coming from. Instead of, “How
on earth can this person be so irrational?” think, “Wow, this person looks at
the same situation and comes to completely different conclusions. I wonder what
her perspective looks like. Does she know something I don’t? Or has she
considered aspects I’ve not thought of?” This will steer you away from feeling
offended and toward genuine interest when someone disagrees with your opinion.

Second, don’t assume the person you’re conversing with has bad intentions.
Instead, focus on their actions.

Your friend comments that you look tired, for example. You might think that she
intended to insult you, but don’t jump to conclusions. Perhaps she’s concerned
about you and wants to offer help.

Third, stop blaming others and start figuring out everyone’s contribution
instead.

Blaming someone else won’t solve anything – it’s a backward-looking tactic that
focuses on judgment and incites resentment.

Instead, sit down with the other person and try to work through the situation
together. Try asking, “How did the two of us contribute to this mess?” followed
by, “What can we both do to change the situation and move forward?”

## Improve the Feelings Conversation by exploring, negotiating and sharing your feelings.

It’s not easy dealing with emotions, and it’s even harder trying to share them.
When they threaten to embarrass us, we even go so far as to suppress our
feelings. However, the Learning Conversation can help us address difficult
emotions in three easy steps.

First, let’s find out what’s really happening deep down. You can do this by
exploring your **emotional footprint. **This is your way of reacting
emotionally, guided by what you consider ok to express and what you believe is
better kept to yourself.

Ask yourself questions such as, “How did you learn to categorize some feelings
as inappropriate?” “How did you handle feelings as a child?” and “Did your
partner scold you for being ‘needy’ when you craved intimacy?”

Exploring your emotional footprint will help you identify what it is that
you’re feeling.

Next, you have to negotiate those feelings. Feelings aren’t constant – they
change depending on our perceptions.

Like in the “What Happened?” Conversation, you need to focus on curiosity,
impact and contribution.

If you’re constantly arguing with your partner, it might be worthwhile to ask
yourself, “Do I make assumptions about his intentions? Do I blame him and
ignore my own impact?”

After you address your assumptions, you’ll start to feel differently about the
situation. If you resented your mother for always nagging you to look for a
job, ask yourself, “Does she really do so because she wants to punish me for
not being successful? Or because she’s concerned about my wellbeing?” If it’s
the latter, consider how this affects your emotions.

The last step is to share your feelings – both good and bad – in a thoughtful
manner.

If you just throw your pent-up emotions at the other person, you’ll make a
difficult conversation worse. When it comes to correctly expressing yourself,
you need to let both the good and the bad out.

Instead of telling your mother, “I’m angry with you,” tell her, “I’m thankful
for your concern, but I am also angry because I told you that I don’t like
discussing my job search, and yet you keep bringing it up, and it makes me feel
like a loser.”

## Focus on the intricacies of the Identity Conversation and refrain from controlling others’ reactions.

You know who you are, more or less. But you also tend to judge yourself in
absolute terms: competent or useless, mean or kind, capable or incapable of
being loved.

Absolute terms such as these are limiting because nothing’s black and white,
and as a result, you can quickly get confused about your own identity.

Instead, reflect on the fact that your identity comprises of many components.
Think about the different traits that you deem important – characteristics that
you’re proud of and afraid of losing.

For example, say the trait you like most about yourself is loyalty: one day, at
work, you receive a highly attractive offer from a competing firm, which you
hesitate to accept because it would make you a disloyal person.

Once you figure out which parts of your identity you value the most, you can
begin to build complexities.

Diverting from the typical black-and-white-approach to identity issues, you
need to challenge the thought that accepting the job makes you disloyal. Have
you not been loyal to your boss after all these years, despite being underpaid?
The reason you’re considering this job is that you want to show loyalty to your
family by taking better care of them.

Most situations aren’t all-or-nothing, and neither is our identity. So stop
wasting time and energy fighting every time someone challenges our
self-perception.

Another way to enhance the Identity Conversation is by balancing yourself
during the talk. To do so, give up the notion that you can control the other
person’s reactions.

Abandoning that thought makes it easier to focus and remain on course. You
might think that if you say something in a particular way your partner won’t
get angry. But the truth is you can never predict these reactions. Once you
come to terms with that, unexpected reactions won’t be as unsettling.

## Tell a neutral Third Story.

Though difficult conversations are tricky to initiate, you need to start
somewhere.

A good rule of thumb is to never start inside your own story.

Your perspective is seldom a good starting point. This is because your story
could threaten the self-image of the person you’re talking to.

During a difficult conversation with a partner, you might say something like,
“What you said about me in front of your friends upset me,” which they may
misinterpret as, “Either you intended to betray me by saying that, or you
betrayed me accidentally because you’re thoughtless.” The result is that your
partner becomes defensive or aggressive as a way to protect their perception of
being a thoughtful and loyal partner.

So how are you supposed to address any issues without causing hurt or
defensiveness? The answer is by telling a **Third Story**.

A Third Story is one told from the view of an impartial observer. It points out
the difference between the tales of the two parties involved.

Let’s say you had a problem with your flatmate never cleaning the dishes. Your
story might start by saying, “I do all the cleaning,” while your flatmate’s
story is, “Let’s discuss why you’re so anal about dishes.” Neither of these are
good starting points for a fruitful conversation, which is why you must turn to
the Third Story: “Our definitions of cleanliness and our preferences for doing
dishes differ.” Nobody passes judgment with this statement, so there’s no need
for anyone to be on the defensive. With this approach, you and your flatmate
can look for a solution that satisfies both parties.

Following these guidelines, you’ll be able to convert any difficult
conversation into a meaningful and productive one.
