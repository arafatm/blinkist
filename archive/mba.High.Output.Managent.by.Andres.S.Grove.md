## The key message in this book:

The responsibilities of a manager are multi-faceted and the changing nature of
work has transformed the role. This means modern managers are responsible for
gathering information, making decisions, acting as role models, fostering
motivation and flexibly assessing their employees.

## Actionable advice:

**Decide whether being friends with your subordinates is right for you.**

People often wonder whether it’s OK to form a friendship with people who work
under them. That’s because such relationships can be difficult to maintain,
especially when the higher-up has to take disciplinary action against her
subordinate. 

So, as a manager you want to be clear where you stand on this issue. Simply
imagine giving a critical performance review to an already close friend. If you
can do that, then forming personal ties might make sense and could be used to
strengthen your professional relationships.

## What’s in it for me? Learn what successful management entails.

Management seems like an overwhelming task. Managers are expected to be
everywhere at every time, to listen and speak to their staff, to plan and
organize workflows, to bring the best out of their employees and enhance
overall performance. But how can one person master so many tasks?

In these blinks, you’ll find out what the key responsibilities of a manager are
and what you need to know about your employees and your role. You will learn
how to collect the information you need to make the right decisions, how to
motivate your team and how to make them perform well.

You’ll also learn
- what management has to do with serving breakfast;
- how to find out quickly whether an employee lacks skill or motivation; and
- why managers may take a leaf out of a sports coach’s playbook.

## Managing a company is like serving breakfast – it requires a sound understanding of production processes.

It might seem an odd idea, but working as a waiter will perfectly prepare you
to manage the production processes of a company.

How come?

Well, managing production processes is actually just like serving breakfast.
For instance, if your job is to deliver a three-minute boiled egg, toast and
coffee, you’re already facing the essential requirements of production. You
need to respond to demand by delivering your product according to a given
schedule while meeting expectations for quality and keeping down costs.

To succeed at this complicated series of tasks you need to keep the first
question of production in mind: which step is the hardest to complete?

When it comes to serving breakfast, it’s definitely boiling the egg as it takes
the longest time. All the remaining steps should be planned around the time
needed to accomplish this task.

Then, once you’ve identified the priority step in production, it’s your job as
a manager to find the most cost-effective way to use the resources at your
disposal.

Imagine a waiter has to stand in line every morning to use the toaster while
his customer waits for her breakfast. How can he resolve the problem? His
options are to ask a coworker for help, prepare toast in advance or buy another
toaster.

Essentially, managers are there to identify and solve these kinds of
bottlenecks, and their solutions include hiring a larger workforce, increasing
inventory or buying more equipment. But remember, all of these choices cost
money, and the task of a manager is to balance them in the most cost-effective
way.

But that’s not all; managers also need to detect problems. That’s because
problems arise all the time in production; to control damage, it’s essential to
find and fix them as early as possible.

For example, if the kitchen ends up with a bunch of rotten eggs, it’d be better
to find that out when they’re in the fridge and before they’re being boiled or
tipped onto a customer’s plate. This means it’s essential for managers to
monitor carefully all production processes.

## Managers need to know how to select production indicators and extract important information from them.

Naturally, a manager can’t be everywhere at once. To get a comprehensive
overview, a manager needs to rely on good measurements.

To do so, she should choose at least five **indicators** that are presented to
her every morning upon arrival at work.

First, she’ll want the **sales forecasts** right away. In other words, how many
breakfasts will she have to make today?

Second, the **inventory levels** are key. That’s because she needs to know how
many eggs, loaves of bread and pounds of coffee she has in reserve.

Third, she needs to know the** condition of the equipment**. Because if her
only toaster called it quits yesterday, it’s essential to replace it before
rush hour.

Fourth, it’s important to have an update on the **workforce**. After all, if
three waiters have called in sick, the manager needs to find substitutes right
away.

And finally, she’ll want a **quality** indicator that measures public opinion.
Basically, did customers like the breakfast they were served?

But having these production indicators isn’t enough; a manager also needs to
know how to extract important information from them. One good strategy for this
involves pairing two of them together.

For instance, to better understand your inventory levels, you should check them
against your sales forecasts to determine the potential for inventory
shortages. This will help you decide what the critical inventory level is.

You should also pair indicators with the actual results you’re achieving. For
example, if you were evaluating a salesperson, you wouldn’t just consider the
number of calls she made but also the number of deals she closed.

You can also extract helpful information from indicators by examining trends.
For instance, our manager can compare the number of breakfasts she served this
month to previous months to assess her performance and make a prediction about
whether she’ll serve more or less in the coming month.

## A manager holds many responsibilities and her success depends on that of her team.

It might not always seem like it, but management is a team effort. This is why
a manager isn’t just rated on their personal skills and individual performance,
but also the working achievements of her team.

For instance, if a manager does well at planning production, allocating
resources and sniffing out mistakes, but her staff fails to execute, the
manager is still responsible.

So, how can you improve your team’s performance overall?

Well, one of a manager’s key responsibilities when running a team is to collect
and share information.

Sometimes the best way to do that is through quick, informal conversations.
After all, a few words shared between a manager and an employee at the coffee
machine will spread a lot faster than any memo.

However, asking for written reports from team members is also key. That’s
because the discipline it takes to write a report makes the employee reflect on
her work and better comprehend current issues. That makes reports essential for
providing valuable information to a manager.

But managers are also responsible for making decisions, which makes the
previous responsibility of collecting and sharing information all the more
essential. For example, it’s up to a manager to decide to open a new branch or
hire new employees. To do so she’ll need detailed information on all the
possible choices as well as their pros and cons.

Finally, it’s also a manager’s job to be a role model. A manager who spends
working time making personal calls is unlikely to motivate their team. On the
other hand, a manager who puts in long hours and takes the work seriously will
provide a great example for others to follow.

Just remember, values can’t be communicated through memos and conversations
alone. This means managers need to **show** the right way to behave. After all,
nothing leads better than an example.

## Meetings are an essential managerial tool and they come in different types.

Many managers consider meetings the curse of their existence, and Peter
Drucker, a leader in modern management, has even said that spending more than
25 percent of your time in meetings is a sign of poor organization. But
nevertheless, meetings are essential to any manager’s daily routine.

That’s because meetings are the foundation for all other managerial activities.
For instance, you just learned about a manager’s core duties: gathering
information, making decisions and serving as an example. Not one of these can
be done well without holding meetings.

So, you don’t need to be terrified if meetings are taking up half your day.
They’re simply the necessary medium through which management works.

That being said, there are different types of meetings. A **mission-oriented**
meeting is meant to solve specific problems by arriving at a decision. These
tend to be held spontaneously as an emergency arises, like a meeting called at
the last minute to quickly deal with a huge product malfunction.

Another kind of meeting is **process-oriented**. Here, information and opinions
about less pressing matters are shared. These meetings rely on regularity to
pay off. The most well-known form is a **one-on-one** meeting between a
supervisor and her employee – an opportunity for them both to get informed.

With inexperienced subordinates, this type of meeting should usually occur once
a week, but its frequency also depends on the job area and how quickly
conditions change. For example, you’ll need to hold them more often in a
marketing environment, where the work pace is faster than in, say, a research
department.

Ideally, these one-on-ones last around an hour and occur in or near the
employee’s workspace as their environment might be revealing. By looking at
your employee’s desk you can tell whether he’s organized or if he suffers from
frequent disruptions.

## It’s a manager’s responsibility to foster motivation.

Imagine an employee isn’t living up to expectations. Do you know how to quickly
determine whether he lacks skills or just needs more motivation?

Just ask yourself, “could he perform his task if his life depended on it?”

If the answer is yes, then he’s probably struggling with low motivation.
There’s no way you could play the violin beautifully without being a trained
musician. But if you had to run 6 miles to flee a serial killer, you’d probably
make it even if you weren’t in great shape. The fact is, employees who perform
inefficiently usually lack skills or motivation.

Therefore, it’s no surprise that motivation has become central to modern
management, in large part due to the rise of **knowledge workers** whose main
source of capital is information. After all, the quality of work performed by a
manual laborer is easy to assess. That’s because if a poorly motivated
bricklayer builds a crooked wall, the foreman will immediately notice and take
corrective measures.

But when it comes to knowledge workers, it’s hard to immediately tell if a task
was done properly without being an expert in the field they’re operating in.
That means it’s even more important to keep employees motivated to prevent
these costly, tricky-to-spot errors.

So, it’s up to a manager to motivate her employees. But motivation can only
come from within, which means a manager’s job is to foster an environment that
helps employees maintain their own motivation.

To do so, a manager needs to know whether her employees are
**competence-driven** or **achievement-driven **individuals.

The former are motivated to expand their knowledge and skills. Think of a
stellar musician who practices daily to improve his technique. Managers should
encourage these employees to produce tangible results and deter them from
focusing solely on self-improvement.

The other type, achievement-driven employees, are driven by success. Employees
like this should be put in a context where their objectives are ambitious
enough that they flourish.

## Employees can’t be motivated by financial rewards alone; they need feedback and support from their managers.

Every worker expects to be rewarded for their professional commitments, and
money is probably the most obvious reward. But is it the best?

Well, up to a certain point, money is an incredible motivator, but it has its
limits.

For example, some people who are already rich see money only as a status symbol
that shows the outside world how successful they are. Someone like this doesn’t
really need additional income, so earning one, two or five million more won’t
impact their motivation much.

On the other hand even employees who depend on their salaries to support
themselves find money’s motivational potential limited. That’s because money
motivates people, but only until they achieve a decent standard of living where
their basic needs are satisfied. After that, these employees will want more
meaningful and relevant rewards.

So, how can you keep employees at peak performance?

By setting up a system that gauges their success. In fact, this is the only way
for workers to make real progress.

Just look at the competence-driven employees who love to expand their knowledge
and skills. The best tactic for motivating them is to show them that they still
have potential to improve. Because without this potential, the desire to do
better all but disappears.

To demonstrate the space for improvement, a manager can provide evaluations and
feedback through, for instance, performance reviews that rate an employee on
his achievements.

But remember, when reviewing performance, it’s essential for a manager to know
how a fear of failure can turn certain achievement-driven people into overly
cautious underperformers. It’s crucial to communicate the importance of
accepting failure and supporting such employees whenever they need it.

## To enhance performance, managers should encourage competition at work and take on the role of a coach.

Maybe you’ve come across people in your office who are slow workers and show
little motivation, but can still push themselves to the limit to run a full
marathon. What motivates people like this?

Simply put, the desire to beat others.

That’s because, when in competition, people are much more likely to take on
challenges. This drive to beat the distance, stopwatch or competition is a
result of **self-actualization**, an idea brought to prominence by the
psychologist Abraham Maslow in 1954.

A person who feels that she has the potential to master a challenge will also
be compelled to take it on. She will feel this compulsion because of a need to
attain her own potential – actualize herself – through the challenge. It’s no
surprise, therefore, that the best environment for self-actualization is
competitive sports.

So, what does this mean for a manager?

That you have to bring the sporting spirit of competition into the workplace,
and that means letting employees compare themselves to their coworkers. For
instance, the maintenance service that cleaned Intel’s facilities performed
poorly for years until a program was created to put the teams from each
building into competition with one another by rating their work and comparing
the scores.

Though there were no further incentives than the desire to beat the others, the
cleanliness of every building improved dramatically, proving that competition
alone can increase performance.

In some respects, a good manager should act as if she were the coach of a
sports team. For example, a coach never takes credit for the team’s success,
and neither should a manager, because it might make her team feel cheated out
of their well-deserved congratulations.

Coaches also sometimes need to be tough on their players to force the best
performance out of them. Similarly, managers need to know how to give employees
constructive criticism.

## There’s no perfect management style, but there is a way to find the right style for the situation.

You might be wondering, is there one approach to management that trumps all
others? Probably not.

That’s because management styles are prone to shifts and no perfect style has
yet emerged. For instance, in the early twentieth century, management was harsh
and strictly hierarchical. Employees followed orders and didn’t question their
superiors.

Management theory then very slowly evolved into a more gentle approach that
took the individual employee into consideration instead of just his
productivity. But despite this transformation, researchers of motivation and
leadership have never settled on one optimal style.

However, for any given situation, researchers can point to a variable that
indicates which approach should be relied on. This style of assessing your
subordinates is called **task-relevant maturity**, or **TRM**.

It’s a combination of an employee’s tendencies toward responsibility and
achievement, as well as her education, training and experience. As a result, a
worker’s TRM might be higher for one task or field and low for another.

For instance, a sales manager’s TRM could be high for sales but low when she’s
managing a production process. Asking her to do the latter would be a little
like forcing a person who’s used to navigating on small country roads to all of
a sudden drive on a major freeway.

So, TRM levels can vary, and different management styles are required according
to an employee’s ranking. For instance, if an employee has a low TRM for a
certain task, a manager should lay out the process in clear, detailed
instructions.

Then, as the employee’s TRM increases, the manager can reduce her involvement
while still monitoring progress. In this way, the manager–employee relationship
mimics that between a parent and child.

As a child ages, parenting style shifts. After all, a toddler needs to be told
not to touch dangerous objects, but there’s no need to explain to a teenager
why she shouldn’t touch the blade of a sharp knife. And the same goes for your
employees. As they grow, they’ll learn for themselves how to best succeed.
