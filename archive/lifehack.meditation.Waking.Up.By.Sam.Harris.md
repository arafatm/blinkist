## Final summary

Our concept of self is illusory and keeps us caught in a dream
of malcontent and discursive thought. However, by **practicing
meditation** we can awaken from that dream, and in doing so
live life at full attention.

## What’s in it for me? Discover a non religious path to mindfulness and spirituality.

We know what we need to do in order to be spiritual: we need to
find god and open ourselves up to a higher plane. Right? Not
quite, discovering spirituality – or a different form of
consciousness – does not require religion. We can all do it
here in the mortal world.

All we need to find spirituality is transform the way we think.
We must stop thinking in terms of pleasure and pain or that we
are a single, rational being.  Instead we have to concentrate
on becoming more mindful of our thoughts and our true selves.

In these blinks, you’ll discover
- how many “selves” you have;
- why you shouldn’t always trust a “guru”; and
- why the path to spirituality may lie with acid.

## Seeking pleasures and avoiding pain will not result in happiness.

So what’s the best way to live a happy and fulfilled life, if
not by seeking pleasure and avoiding pain?

Children may spend their time eagerly eyeing the cookie jar
while kicking and screaming to avoid having to eat their
broccoli. While tantrums like these may get children their
pleasures, it, unfortunately doesn’t work out so easily for
adults.

In part, it’s because our pleasures are fleeting. Even if you
find that perfect moment of pleasure – absolute bliss even –
the feeling will soon fade, and soon you’ll start chasing a new
moment.

This plays out constantly in our daily lives. Imagine, for
example, that you finally have your long-awaited day out at the
beach. The sun feels wonderful on your skin until you start to
break a sweat. So, you seek a new pleasure – relief in the
shade – until that cool breeze becomes a little too cold. As
you reach for the warmth of your t-shirt, you notice how
tattered it’s become, and you need a new one. You like the idea
of new clothes, but you hate shopping, and so on.

Not only are these moments of pleasure and pain fleeting; they
also depend more on our perceptions than reality.

Imagine, for example, that you’re sitting on a chair wired to a
“feeling machine” that can trigger any feeling in you. The
sadist operating the machine inflicts great pain on your body:
all your muscles tense, you start sweating and breathing
heavily and your heartbeat is throbbing in your head.

Our experience, that is, the pain in our bodies, is perceived
as a horror – one that we would almost certainly avoid at all
costs.

However, aren’t these sensations the same as the ones we
experience when we lift weights at the gym? Some people love
that feeling!

Clearly, there is **more to finding happiness than just seeking
pleasure and avoiding pain**.

## Although we see ourselves as a single unified “self” this is not the case.

What are you, really? Who is the “I” that you speak of? Most of
us will assume that “I,” as in their sense of self, is a single
entity that exists in the brain and which they identify with,
which observes through the eyes and that is the originator of
our thoughts.

However, this is simply not the case.  

Firstly, we aren’t even the thinkers of our thoughts, and our
sense of control over them is totally illusory.

Try this exercise: make yourself comfortable and try not to
think any thoughts for an entire minute.

How did you fare? Of course, you couldn’t do it. You might have
had thought-free moments between thoughts, but some thoughts
nevertheless came to your mind. Indeed, we have little control
over our thoughts. They simply appear in our minds uninvited.

Next, even the idea of the self as a single entity is an
illusion. Indeed, the creator of our “selves,” the brain, is in
fact composed of different hemispheres, the right and the left,
each with its own personality.

But how can we know this? Doctors sometimes perform a medical
procedure known as **callosotomy, **which splits the
hemispheres in the brain. Interestingly, people who have
undergone this surgery demonstrate widely different traits
depending on which side of the brain is stimulated.  

One famous example of this is from a study on a young
split-brain patient who was asked what he wanted to become when
he grew up. His left hemisphere replied, “a draftsman,” while
his right side had replied, “a racing driver.”

Clearly, we overestimate our control over our thoughts, and as
a result we lend them greater power than they deserve. But what
can we do to overcome their power and gain perspective?

## Becoming “mindful” of our thoughts and worries can help us overcome their power over us.

Try this experiment: simply observe your thoughts for a while.
Where do they wander? Do you think about the things you’ve done
in the past, or perhaps the future?

This is all perfectly natural. We spend most of our time
worrying about the future and brooding about the past. But is
this actually in our best interest?

Our lives are often unsatisfactory because we spend our time
worrying about what has happened or what might happen instead
of actually living. Think about it: When you woke up this
morning, you likely experienced some lingering negative
thoughts that made you unhappy. Maybe you were thinking about
this week’s huge workload, or the fact that you have to
organize the Christmas party alone.

The problem, however, isn’t the worries themselves. Rather,
because you identify with these worries, they dominate you. So,
when you’re stressed out, you don’t think “I am now aware that
I am experiencing certain feelings of despair,” but rather “Oh
my god, everything is terrible and there is no way out.”

But there **is **a way out: by using the meditative technique
of **mindfulness**, you can separate your thoughts and worries
from yourself.

When you meditate, you become aware of the contents of your
consciousness – your impressions, feelings and thoughts. Not
only do you become aware of them; you also begin to recognize
that they don’t represent reality. They are merely the
constructs of your mind.

It’s like watching a horror film: if you allow yourself to
become engrossed in the film, then you’ll be more likely to be
constantly looking behind you and jump skittishly at strange
noises.

However, when you remember that it’s just an image on a screen,
the horror will lose its power. You may still be frightened,
but you will have more control.

## Meditation is the process of increasing your awareness, which allows you to see that your thoughts are just passing impressions.

Having an intellectual understanding of the illusory self is
good, but you also need some ways to make this information
applicable to your life. So how can we influence our
mindfulness? One way is with meditation. By using these
meditation techniques, you can start making mindfulness a part
of your life:

First, start by closing your eyes and concentrating on the act
of breathing, slowly and purposefully.

It’s an absolute certainty that, while you’re focusing on your
breathing, thoughts and feelings will pop into your head from
time to time.

When this happens, simply acknowledge them and return your
focus back to your breathing. By being mindful of your thoughts
and feelings without letting them take the reins, you will
start to recognize them as being separate from your
consciousness, and thus you won’t be driven by them.

Furthermore, research indicates a connection between meditation
and a realization that we are not one “self”:

Numerous studies have shown that our mind wanders for about 50
percent of our waking life. During these periods of
wistfulness, a region of the brain known as the **default-mode
network** (DMN) becomes more active.

This region is partly responsible for our tendency to think
about and judge ourselves. In essence, it is the root of the
concept of “I,” the single, thinking entity.

However, when we’re focused on something, as during meditation,
we weaken the power of the DMN. In other words, we stop
thinking about “ourselves” as much.  Experienced meditators can
even weaken the DMN’s influence on their thoughts outside of
the time they spend meditating.

Indeed, meditation is a powerful tool!

## There’s a slow approach and an immediate approach, that both lead to the realization that “I” is an illusion; take the fast route.

In meditation, there two main types of approach, generally
speaking.

The first is the **gradual approach**, which traces its roots
back to the earliest surviving form of Buddhism, Theravada
Buddhism. Theravada Buddhists conceptualized **selflessness**,
that is, the rejection of the single, thinking self, as being
the end of a very long road.

Yet, as you travel along the road toward your goal, you still
think in terms of the self: “I” need to focus on “my”
breathing, “I” must not be distracted by “my” thoughts, and so
on. The idea is that, eventually, you will simply come to the
realization that the self does not exist.

Then there is the **sudden realization **technique, put forward
by the Dzogchen school of Buddhism.

Here, you don’t seek to discover through slow realization that
the self does not exist. Rather, you assume from the very
beginning that it is an illusion.

The idea is to then use that awareness in ways that help you to
lead a better life.

Of those two broad approaches, sudden realization is better
suited for dismissing the concept of “self.”

The gradual approach is like climbing a mountain with
enlightenment at its peak. You become the intrepid mountaineer,
pushing yourself hard to reach the top. But what do you gain
from this effort?

When the author started meditating in the spirit of gradualism,
he attended several meditation retreats, each lasting several
weeks. There were even some where he meditated for up to
eighteen hours a day!

Yet, despite his commitment, he never was able to reach the
point of selflessness. It was only when he switched to Dzogchen
instruction that he was able to have this experience.

## Spirituality is an empirical matter, and not a religious one.

In everyday language, the concept of **spirituality **is
closely tied to religious thought. In actuality, however,
spirituality and religion have little to do with one another.

Spirituality is little more than the attempt to induce
non-ordinary states of consciousness. Although people often
turn to religion to achieve this, these efforts also lend
themselves to meditation or even psychedelic drugs.

What’s more, schools of religious thought are simply unable to
credibly claim that their brand of spirituality is the only
kind.

There are a multitude of spiritual experiences, like
self-transcending love, bliss, ecstasy or “inner light,” which
are common among all types of believers (Christians, Muslims,
Jews, etc.), as well as non-believers.

Religious organizations cannot hold a monopoly on spirituality.
All claim to do so (by proclaiming that they follow the one
true God), but they can’t all be right. According to a
Christian, a Muslim should never be able to experience
spirituality because his beliefs are “wrong.” But we **all
**can have spiritual experiences, regardless of our religious
convictions.

Despite these obvious contradictions, many people in the West
nevertheless struggle to disconnect spirituality from religion,
because spirituality in western religions is entirely
faith-based. Although the act of prayer itself can have
spiritual benefits, these benefits are instead attributed to
the religious convictions that inspire prayer, rather than the
act itself.

Eastern religions, on the other hand, are empirical at their
core.  Consequently, they’re concerned with experiences and
observations of reality.  For this reason, you can perform
Buddhist meditation without actually believing in any of the
Buddhist religious doctrines. Meditation itself is a set of
empirical instructions for experiencing different states of
consciousness.

Even the “enlightened” Siddhartha Gautama, the primary figure
in Buddhism, was simply a man who awoke from the dream of being
a separate self. He never made any claims of divinity!

## Choose your gurus carefully.

Starting on the path to mindfulness and a more spiritual life
isn’t easy. It is very likely that, in order to succeed, you’ll
need the guidance of an experienced teacher. In fact, certain
paths, such as Dzogchen, **require** you to follow an
instructor.

However, finding the right teacher is no small feat!

For starters, it’s quite difficult to discern whether a
spiritual teacher has the necessary expertise to be **your
**teacher. In contrast with other areas of expertise, such as
academic, career or sport expertise, demonstrating mastery
isn’t easy.

If you want to improve your putt, for example, then finding a
skilled golf teacher is relatively simple. All they have to do
is demonstrate to you that they can get the ball in the hole.
Of course, there’s more to it, but that’s the basic idea.

So, how would you demonstrate spiritual expertise? It’s simply
impossible.

What’s more, the nature of spirituality makes it easy for
charlatans and megalomaniacs to exploit the student-teacher
relationship.

In other words, if your golf instructor urged you to shave your
head and renounce sex, you would almost certainly start looking
for a new teacher.  However, these kinds of demands are not
uncommon for spiritual communities.

Moreover, the goal of abandoning the illusion of self can be
used as a legitimation for practices that make you feel
uncomfortable or are downright exploitive.

For instance, it may make you feel uncomfortable or exploited
if your teacher ordered you to undress in front of him. Yet,
your teacher could easily explain away your discomfort as being
your ego’s resistance to detaching itself from the body.

So, while finding a good teacher is an important part of your
journey to selflessness, you should nonetheless be careful in
researching and choosing the right one.

## If you decide to use drugs on your path to spirituality, be careful.

If you’ve ever imbibed enough alcohol, then you will certainly
testify that the experience temporarily changed your perception
of reality and yourself. For instance, you may have felt more
confident or aggressive, or had a hard time following an
argument.

This modification of your consciousness is even more extreme
with other drugs, some of which even offer a glimpse of what
it’s like to experience a selfless consciousness.

Ingesting MDMA, for example, induces peace of mind, and raises
your empathy and affection for the other people around you.
This experience may come relatively close to the state of
mindfulness.

Other psychedelic drugs, such as LSD or psilocybin mushrooms,
offer even more radical departures from your everyday
experiences. These profound and novel experiences can open you
up to a whole new conception of what is possible in terms of
consciousness.

However, while these drugs offer the benefit of altered
consciousness, they also come with risks. For example, studies
indicate that MDMA may be **neurotoxic**, that is, it may have
a damaging effect on parts of your brain.

What’s more, taking mind-altering drugs, such as MDMA
specifically, always involves the risk of addiction.

Drugs are also fickle things. They don’t always deliver what
they promise, and some can lead to experiences that are
unparalleled in their horror.

For example, while the author was on a trip to Nepal, he
consumed LSD while sitting in a boat on a lake. As the drugs
took effect, he imagined that both the lake and the boat had
disappeared, and what was left was only an ineffable terror in
material form. For the next several hours he was left with only
his mind, which had become an instrument of self-torture.

While drugs might be a tool in the path to selflessness, they
are nonetheless to be handled with the utmost care.
