# The Virgin Way

## Final summary

Success in business is a combination of hard work, luck and having the
courage to follow your convictions. As a phenomenally successful entrepreneur,
Branson has learned that doing things your own way is nearly always better than
sticking to the status quo.

## What’s in it for me? Life lessons from the billionaire school dropout.

As a multi-billionaire and the owner of hundreds of successful businesses,
Richard Branson knows a thing or two about leadership. This legendary leader
has put pen to paper to share over four decades of triumph, failure and lessons
about the Virgin way to lead. But as you’ll find out, the Branson brand isn’t
built on great leadership alone. You’ll discover how exemplary listening
skills, a generous spirit and a zest for fun have all shaped his story and
philosophy of life.

From his early childhood and years as a high-school dropout to opening his
first-ever Virgin Records store, you’ll witness the formative experiences of
one of the world’s most eccentric entrepreneurs and learn that he’s never been
afraid to do things differently. So sit back and enjoy Branson’s insightful
anecdotes about some of the world’s most famous brands.

In these blinks, you’ll discover
- what leadership lesson Branson learned from his father;
- how procrastination saved him from the financial crash; and
- why innovators are always being told no.

## Branson’s upbringing made him a compassionate leader.  

Our parents give us a lot, from their time and attention to their eye colors.
But what about the less obvious things that make us who we are, such as our
personality and general life philosophy? Richard Branson believes that his
approach to leadership is all thanks to the way his parents raised him.

As a young boy, Branson often visited the local shop to buy chocolate bars.
Unfortunately, he paid for his chocoholic habit by pilfering small change from
his parents’ bedroom. When the shopkeeper eventually told his father Ted of her
suspicions, the young Branson expected a mighty punishment.

But to his surprise, his father took little action – he didn’t even acknowledge
that he knew about the theft. In fact, all his father did was give his son the
cold shoulder for the rest of the day. Though he escaped punishment, Branson
never stole his parents’ money again. Why? Because he knew full well that he
had disappointed his father – Ted’s silence made that clear, and no harsh
reprimand was needed.

As an adult and an employer of tens of thousands of people, Branson has tried
to live up to his dad’s example of leniency. When Branson was running Virgin
Records, for example, he became aware that one of his younger employees, a
talented Artists and Repertoire (A&amp;R) person, was stealing records and
selling them to other stores. Though Branson would have every reason to fire
him, he remembered his own experience of stealing and his father’s kindness.

Thus, after privately confronting the employee about his theft, he gave him a
second chance and allowed him to keep his job. The result? Just like the
younger Branson, this employee never stole anything again. Moreover, he became
a great asset to the company, discovering several hit artists, including the
singer Boy George.

Unfortunately, Branson’s humane attitude is at odds with some of his business
contemporaries. US President and billionaire businessman Donald Trump, for
instance, previously delighted in publicly denigrating people and firing them
on his TV show **The Apprentice**. This may have all been for entertainment,
but it nonetheless reflects the hard-nosed and authoritarian values that many
business leaders subscribe to.

Fortunately, though, that’s not the Virgin way of doing things.

## The ability to truly listen is the unsung secret of business success.

When it comes to qualities we look for in a leader, listening features rather
far down on the list. Instead, we focus on their powers of oration – their
speaking skills.

Just consider two esteemed leaders of the twentieth century, Winston Churchill
and John F. Kennedy. Ask anyone what made these men great, and they’ll probably
mention great speeches. Indeed, Churchill’s ‘Finest Hour’ speech in 1940 and
Kennedy’s famous inaugural address in 1961 have defined both leaders’ legacies.

But even if their oratory skills were applauded, Churchill’s and Kennedy’s
successes amounted to much more. In fact, Branson believes that these great men
must have been great listeners, too. In Branson’s opinion, listening is a
woefully underrated skill and the hallmark of many excellent leaders.

Over four decades ago, Branson started a lifelong habit of listening intently
to what others had to say, and diligently noting down any interesting remarks
they made. As a teenager, Branson interviewed the famous novelist John Le Carre
for his magazine, **Student**. Although he usually brought a tape recorder to
his interviews, it was old and rarely worked. As such, he began diligently
noting down his interviewee’s responses. And the behavior stuck – these days he
has hundreds of notebooks, filled with his own and others’ reflections.

And it’s not just Branson himself whose career has benefited from a policy of
careful listening and note-taking. In the 1990s, for instance, Branson gave a
speech in Greece about his business. During the question and answer session
with the audience, one young man stood out. Not only did he ask excellent
questions, but he also listened intently enough to ask great follow-up
questions, and even wrote down Branson’s answers.

Who was this eager young man? Well, back then he was simply the son of a
wealthy shipping magnate. But these days, he’s Sir Stelios Haji-Ioannou,
founder of one of the UK’s most successful airlines, EasyJet. To Branson’s
mind, Ioannou’s incredible success just goes to show how far a thirst for
listening, and a passion for note-taking, can take you.

## A successful company is also a fun one.

Ask someone what their company culture is like, and they may look at you
blankly. Indeed, for many of us, the only way we feel as if we’re experiencing
any ‘culture’ in the office is if we eat yogurt at our desks. But that’s not
the Virgin way. In fact, Branson agrees with Peter Drucker, the wise management
consultant who famously said: “Culture eats strategy for breakfast.”

What does a winning company culture look like?

Well, Branson believes it comes down to everyone, from executives and managers
to junior employees, being highly serious – serious about having fun, that is.
Indeed, before Virgin became the business behemoth it is today, the
organization consisted of little more than Branson and his workmates kicking
back on bean bags in Virgin Records’ only shop, having a great time. This was
simply a group of people who enjoyed their jobs and the company of their
colleagues.

Sure, the going was tough sometimes. Hard work and long hours were often part
of the equation. But the reason Virgin is so successful today is that everyone
involved played as hard as they worked. Late night partying is actually
commonplace at Virgin. Branson has witnessed this thoroughly fun-loving culture
in other successful organizations, too. One company that exemplifies this
culture is Southwest Airlines, a low-cost Texas-based airline. For much of its
40-year history, larger-than-life founder Herb Kelleher has steered the
company.

Leading by example, Herb has always tried to inject some fun into his business.
When a competitor almost sued Southwest for plagiarizing their marketing
tagline ‘Just Plane Smart,’ Herb persuaded the other company’s CEO to settle
their dispute with an arm-wrestle! Their customers are also treated to the
cabin staff’s unique sense of humor. One group of passengers once boarded their
plane, only to find that the flight attendants were nowhere to be seen. Where
were they? Hiding in the overhead bins, of which they promptly jumped out,
shouting: “Surprise!”

The result of all this silliness? Not only is Southwest Airlines a great place
to work, but in a notoriously competitive industry, it’s also the only airline
company in history to turn a profit for forty years straight!

## Luck favors the brave and the well-prepared.

How can you make your own luck? Well, an ancient philosopher wisely opined that
“luck is what happens when opportunity meets preparation.” In other words, when
opportunity knocks, you’d better make sure you’re ready to greet it. Let’s take
a look at an example from Branson’s own life to see what happens when these two
elements come together.

The first album that Branson’s fledgling Virgin Records ever released was Mike
Oldfield’s** Tubular Bells**. Unfortunately, though the album was a hit in the
UK, Branson was having a hard time selling it to the Head of Atlantic Records,
Ahmet Ertegun, who thought the record would be unpopular with American
audiences.

One day, after many phone calls from Branson, Ertegun sat in his office and
gave **Tubular Bells** another listen. Into his office walked the film director
William Friedkin, who immediately asked what the music was. On the spot,
Friedkin decided it would be perfect as the soundtrack to his upcoming movie.
That movie turned out to be** The Exorcist**, the hit horror film. Not only did
Atlantic Records buy the album, but the film also brought it to worldwide fame.

Of course, the fact that Friedkin walked in and heard the record was a great
piece of luck, but would Ertegun have been listening to that album if Branson
hadn’t pressured him to give it another try? Probably not.

Another key ingredient for cooking up your own luck is courage. When Branson’s
friend Antonio was a student at Stanford University, he randomly struck up a
conversation with a stranger next to him in a cinema queue, who also turned out
to be a student. Spontaneously, they decided to go for coffee together, where
the stranger told Antonio that he and a friend were launching a company.

When they finished, the stranger showed him what his company was working on.
Though their research was too technical for Antonio to understand, he thought
the idea had potential, and the very next day he pledged to give the student
the $10,000 he’d been saving up to buy a car with. This bought him a 1 percent
share in their nascent business.

A pretty brave move, you’d probably agree! Some might even say foolhardy. What
was that business? Today it’s known as Google – that stranger was Sergey Brin.
Antonio still has his 1 percent stake, but now it’s worth billions of dollars.
Sure, it was lucky that he went for coffee that day. But this piece of luck
wouldn’t have meant anything if Antonio hadn’t had the guts to take a big risk
with his money.

## Procrastinate your way to a great decision.

Making great decisions is arguably the most important part of being a leader.
As the top decision-maker at Virgin, Branson understands that there’s no secret
formula for making the correct call every single time. Indeed, after decades of
getting it mostly right, but sometimes wrong, there’s only one thing he’s sure
about – the best decisions usually take time.

Interestingly, Branson didn’t always take such a measured approach to
decision-making. In fact, for most of his career, he admits he’s been guilty of
jumping into things feet-first, with varying results.

Virgin’s entry into the aviation industry, for instance, was the result of a
quick, instinctual decision on Branson’s part. Instead of commissioning the
reams of market research that would usually accompany such as enormous move, he
decided his gut instinct was sufficient and quickly launched Virgin Atlantic,
and later, Virgin Blue.

Although these two ventures were commercial successes, Branson’s hasty judgment
hasn’t always been so prescient. A similar snap decision, for instance, was to
launch the soda Virgin Cola in 1984 and Virgin Brides, a bridal wear business,
in 1996. Unfortunately, neither of these ventures were profitable.

Nowadays, as a seasoned entrepreneur with decades of both success and failure
under his belt, Branson subscribes to a decision-making approach that’s best
described as purposeful procrastination. In other words, when he’s presented
with a decision, he and his team take as much time as possible to work out the
best course of action. This cautious strategy has proved highly rewarding.

Several years ago, for instance, Branson was approached by Goldman Sachs and
offered the opportunity to invest in a little-known financial commodity. Almost
immediately, members of Branson’s Virgin Money team were recommending he jump
on board. However, as Branson himself had never heard of the commodity, he
insisted that his team dig deeper and try to uncover more potential downsides
of investing. Eventually, after an intensive fact-finding mission, and with
Goldman Sachs pushing him for an answer, Branson politely declined.

Interestingly, that hot financial commodity turned out to be subprime mortgages
– the very thing that would blow up the corporate world in 2007 and cause a
global financial crash. Furthermore, in 2010, Goldman Sachs was fined $550
million for handing out misleading, incomplete information to potential
investors. As Branson now knows, Virgin received that incomplete information.
It was only thanks to his purposeful procrastination that they didn’t lose a
lot of money, as well as their reputation, in the scandal.

## Conventional wisdom is often the enemy of innovation.

As an innovator, your biggest challenge is often persuading naysayers that your
idea will work. In the sixteenth century, Sultan of the Ottoman Empire Bayazid
II wanted to build a bridge across Istanbul’s River Bosphorus, an act that
would connect Europe and Asia. Unfortunately, the engineers of the day were
stumped. Eventually, the Sultan asked an Italian artist named Leonardo da Vinci
to come up with a design.

Incredibly, da Vinci produced a beautiful rendering, based on cutting-edge
mathematical concepts that he was sure would hold. But the rest of the
engineering world sneered at his efforts and told the Sultan that the design
was too fantastical to succeed. Da Vinci’s bridge was never built.

Fast forward 500 years, and today’s innovators are still told no by their
short-sighted contemporaries. Luckily, in his own visionary career, Branson
hasn’t let the naysayers hold him back. When the first Virgin Megastore was
launched in New York, for instance, Branson chose Times Square as the location.
In 1996, Times Square was considered scary – many told Branson that New Yorkers
simply wouldn’t go to that part of town.

Well, they were wrong. Not only did the Times Square megastore quickly begin
making weekly sales of over $1 million, but its presence helped trigger the
redevelopment of the whole Times Square area.

This isn’t the only time Branson has proved his critics wrong. After launching
Virgin Atlantic, for instance, Branson realized that up to 40 percent of the
average passenger’s travel time was actually spent on the ground – often
waiting in the departure lounge. Thus, he decided to make this experience every
bit as luxurious as that spent flying.

While other airlines neglected their passengers on the ground, offering them
little more than bad coffee, Virgin Atlantic launched clubhouse departure
lounges that offered sit-down meals, business centers, haircuts and even
massages. Moreover, these amazing benefits were all included in the price of
the flight, which Virgin’s critics believed would make them financially
unsustainable. Once again, though, Branson proved them wrong.

Indeed, Virgin Atlantic’s perks were so desirable to passengers that even
customers loyal to other airlines began switching over, leaving Virgin’s
competitors scrambling to add swanky departure lounges to their own offerings.
So don’t let conventional wisdom stand in your way. If you’ve got a great idea,
pursue it!

## The leaders of tomorrow need to be guided toward entrepreneurship.

Branson is proud to say that the Virgin way is to always lend a hand to the
young people who will become our next generation of entrepreneurs. Of course,
finding budding entrepreneurs and equipping them with the skills they need to
succeed cannot be done by the business world alone.

That’s why Branson is calling on schools to wake up to the enormous potential
of entrepreneurship and change the way they teach our children. As a school
dropout at the age of 16, Branson believed, as he still does, that the
mainstream school system places too little emphasis on the skills needed for an
entrepreneurial career.

The entrepreneurs of the future, for instance, will need to take risks, deal
with failure and be unafraid to challenge convention. If you spend some time
talking to your average teenager, you’ll probably notice they have these
qualities in spades.

Unfortunately, many schools believe free-thinking young people should have
these qualities drummed out of them in the classroom. And what are they
replaced with? The status quo. Instead of encouraging kids to realize their
true potential or indulge their curiosity and see what career it leads to,
teachers encourage children to enter the same jobs and professions that their
teachers probably suggested, too.

The upshot of this approach is that children are taught an outdated curriculum,
in which algebra is valued over understanding human emotions, and calculus is
taught instead of critical thinking.

So, how can our schools start preparing our children for the future?  

Crucially, they need to get real-life entrepreneurs into the classroom to start
talking to young people about their work. Branson still remembers with
frustration that the only job his teachers ever talked about was teaching! To
open young people’s eyes to a world of possibilities, educators need to engage
with those who have chosen different paths themselves.

Moreover, if you’re an entrepreneur talking to young people, don’t be afraid to
focus on the failure you’ve encountered, as well as your successes. Remember,
tales of resilience in the face of hardship are every bit as valuable to young
minds as those of triumph.
