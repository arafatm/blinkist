## Final summary

There is still war, violence, disease and poverty in the world, but if we put
this into the context of history, we’re looking at a tiny fraction of what once
was. Ever since the age of reason in the eighteenth century, we’ve been making
progress at reducing poverty, disease and war. By reducing superstitions,
racism and warmongering, we’ve turned the world into a much safer and
enlightened place than it’s ever been before.

## What’s in it for me? Brighten your outlook by putting today’s world in some much-needed context.

Think things are bad today? If you get all your information from the daily
news, you just might think we’re living in the worst times ever. But the
reality is, we occupy a period in time that’s better than any other.

If you look at the rates of violence, famine and poverty, they’re each at
all-time lows, while life expectancy, overall wealth and happiness levels are
at all-time highs.

Sure, the environment needs our attention, but even here, the rates of
pollution are down drastically from what they were just a few decades ago. So
rather than panic and despair, you actually have every reason to believe that
things may continue to improve, with more diseases becoming things of the past,
and even less poverty and hunger in the world.

How has all this been possible? Thank the Enlightenment, the movement that took
us out of the Dark Ages and emphasized science, reason and humanism as the
principles that might guide us to a better tomorrow.

In these blinks, you’ll discover
- just how far life expectancy has improved since the dark ages;
- why the poor in England used to be forced to grind bones; and
- why you shouldn’t waste time worrying about artificial intelligence.

## The Enlightenment, which began in eighteenth-century Europe, is at the heart of today’s modern cosmopolitanism.

If you’re familiar with European history, you’ve probably heard of the period
known as **the Enlightenment**. Sometimes referred to as the “age of reason,”
it was a historical watershed moment. Indeed, it profoundly influenced the
future development of Western society.

The Enlightenment started in the first half of the eighteenth century and it
offered a bracing antidote to the rampant ignorance, terror and paranoia to
which society had previously been in thrall.

Prior to the Enlightenment, spells of bad weather were blamed on witches or
angry, sky-dwelling gods; oceans and forests were the domain of evil beasts;
and scores of people were tortured and killed in the name of religion. It was
high time for a change. And thus four main Enlightenment themes began to take
shape:** reason, science, humanism** and **progress**.

Reason means that there are things in the world that are non-negotiable – that
no matter what your so-called sacred text or authoritarian leader says, only
reason can dictate the ultimate right. A good example is slavery. Prior to the
age of reason, slavery was seen as a fact of life, but as the values of
Enlightenment spread, reason shook the foundations of this barbaric practice
and eventually helped bring it down.

With the emphasis on science, people began to value knowledge, especially as it
pertained to certain universal human traits. Early versions of neuroscience,
psychology and cultural anthropology opened the door to **humanism**, which
offered a secular way for people to understand and respect one another. Before
this period, religious fervor had been responsible for the bloodbath of the
Crusades, and humanism offered a moral footing to acknowledge that genocide and
murderous conquests weren’t acceptable.

Humanism also led to what’s known as **cosmopolitanism**, which can be seen in
today’s modern values. Cosmopolitanism is a rejection of tribalism and the
narrow-mindedness that pits one group against all others. It looks at everyone
as a child of the world and recognizes that just because someone was born in a
different country doesn’t mean they’re less deserving of the same rights.

## While many suggest that things are worse than ever, we’re still experiencing the benefits of the Enlightenment.

Though people didn’t know it at the turn of the nineteenth century, there’s a
very good reason for the establishment of a cosmopolitan system of global trade
and mutual benefit. Why? Because the more diverse and interconnected a system
becomes, the more resilient it becomes against **entropy.**

Entropy is described in the second law of thermodynamics, and it says that a
closed system will eventually fall apart due to the impact of outside forces.
If you build a sandcastle on the beach and walk away from it, the wind and the
tide, as well as animals and other people, will all but guarantee its
disappearance.

This law of entropy pertains to humans and the entire universe and it’s why
some people will keep insisting that things are in a state of decline. Every so
often, another cultural critic will say that the benefits of the Enlightenment
are long gone and we’re now circling the drain. According to them, one look at
the news suffices to show that reason is out of favor and that war, violence,
crime and resurgent tribalism mentalities reign supreme.

However, there are many holes in this perspective, which we’ll explore in the
blinks ahead. But first, it’s important to recognize that an organism isn’t a
closed system – and can therefore push back against entropy. This is part of
why the Enlightenment can, and has, continued to flourish.

By taking in a growing amount of energy from a variety of sources, an organism
can increase the level of order rather than let that order fall apart. Now, if
we look at any number of graphs and hard, factual data about the state of the
world over the past hundred or more years, we can see that we’re still in the
process of adding energy and greatly improving.

Whether it’s life expectancy, crime rates, happiness levels, wealth or quality
of life, just about every measurable indicator of “the good life” has been on
the rise and shows no sign of stopping. Let’s take a look at some of these
numbers.

## Enlightenment has improved our life expectancy, health and sustenance.

At the start of the Enlightenment, in the mid-eighteenth century, the global
average life expectancy was 29 years. That’s not good at all - even our
hunter-gatherer ancestors are believed to have lived to around 32.5 years!

But post-Enlightenment, the life expectancy of people around the world has
increased by leaps and bounds.

One of the greatest factors is the reduction of the child mortality rate,
which, statistics-wise, significantly improves overall life-expectancy numbers.
And while far fewer infants are dying, mothers are also surviving childbirth at
a much greater rate than they were just a few generations ago. It doesn’t
matter if you’re 50, 60 or 70 years old – you can now expect to live longer
than ever before.

In 1845, a 30-year-old person in Britain could expect to live another 30 years
while an 80-year-old could count on about another five more. In 2011, that
30-year-old could expect another 52 years, while the 80-year-old could expect
nine more years.

This kind of improvement is global: in Ethiopia, a ten-year-old in 1950 could
expect 34 more years, but a ten-year-old today can expect 51 more years.

These years can also be expected to be lived in better health than that of
previous generations, thanks to further gains in knowledge that have led to the
entire or near eradication of diseases such as polio, smallpox, measles and
rubella.

In the 1800s and early 1900s, it didn’t matter if you were the poorest or the
richest person in the world; you were just as likely to die from an infection.
Just consider the son of thirtieth US president Calvin Coolidge. At 16 years
old, Calvin Jr. succumbed to infection after suffering a particularly bad
blister from a game of tennis.

Today, we place value on science and knowledge, and people know the benefits of
washing their hands, using mosquito nets and boiling their drinking water.

Also, remarkably, famine is very nearly a thing of the past.

Just 150 years ago, children in Sweden were starving to death during long
winters. And a mere 45 years ago, 35 percent of the world was malnourished.
That number dropped to an all-time low of 13 percent in 2015. Making this even
more impressive is the fact that five billion people have been added to the
planet in that time.

This is due to the science of agriculture and the progress that has been made,
especially in our ability to use less land and water to grow more
nutrient-packed grains.

## Enlightenment has brought the world more wealth and less inequality.

Prior to the Enlightenment, it was common for a nation’s poor people to be
forced into backbreaking labor for next to no pay. In England, the poor would
grind up bones for fertilizer, while in Paris, they’d be chained together and
made to clean out the city’s drains.

In 1820, close to 90 percent of the world was in extreme poverty, but this is
when the tools of the Enlightenment really began to take effect. Between 1820
and 1900, global income tripled.

Nations, like England, had begun using trade as a tool to improve international
relations, pushing aside religious differences in favor of mutual benefit. This
cosmopolitan attitude was taken up by many other countries and, gradually,
wealth spread across the globe.

Between 1900 and 1950, the world income tripled again, and then it took only 33
years to triple a third time. Now, South Korea and Singapore are getting rich
while Vietnam, Rwanda and El Salvador are doubling their income every 18 years,
with another 40 nations doubling theirs every 35 years.

With this growth, it’s to be expected that a period of inequality will follow.
But as time goes on, this inequality naturally levels itself out, which is what
we’re seeing today. This is called the **Kuznets curve**, named after economist
Simon Kuznets.

A lot of nations experienced fast growth in the 1970s, and at this period
inequality was grossly apparent. But, since then, things have followed the
Kuznets curve: data shows a gradual decline in wealth inequality. This decline
also parallels declining poverty levels.

Another rule we can see in action is **Wagner’s law**, which states that the
wealthier a country gets, the more it spends on social programs that benefit
the poor. In European countries during the early twentieth century, the average
amount of earnings spent was 1.5 percent. Now, an average of 22 percent is
spent on social programs and relief for the poor.

## Enlightenment has reduced violence and brought us to the safest time in history.

There’s little room for optimism in the ongoing war being waged in Syria. Very
conservative estimates have put the number of deaths, in 2016 alone, at 250,000
people. But if you want an accurate assessment of how violent we are globally
these days, the data shows that war is a lot less rampant than it used to be.

You might think there’s an unprecedented number of refugees today, too, but if
we go back a few decades to 1971, we see that the Bangladesh War displaced 10
million people. In 1947, the shift in India’s borders turned 14 million people
into refugees. And, during World War II, 60 million people were forced to flee.

The Enlightenment believed problem-solving was the key to progress and
resolving disputes, and in the twenty-first century, this has been by and large
a success. In 1945, the United Nations was formed, and, with it came the
**Universal Declaration of Human Rights**. Written by a diverse group including
Mohandas Gandhi, Aldous Huxley and Muslim scholars, this is perhaps one of the
most humanist and Enlightenment-aligned documents ever created.

Since then, this organization has been extremely influential in helping settle
disputes, along with the continued trade and commerce agreements that have
helped forge healthy international relations.

So, for 70 years, wars have been few and far between. And in 2009 they became
significantly fewer after a number of civil wars drew to a close, including
ones in Angola, Chad, Peru and Sri Lanka.

With rising wealth across the majority of nations in the world, there’s less of
an opening for militant groups to form an uprising and try to convince the
people that they should join in a revolution. With increased wealth, a nation
can begin offering better health care and education, and the incentive for
civil war is greatly reduced.

This is what we can see in the data from around the globe, and we see fewer
incentives for crime as the world becomes a more prosperous place.

## Democracy, equal rights and a better quality of life are all important values that flourish thanks to Enlightenment.

In the 1970s, things didn’t look so good for democracy. In West Germany,
Chancellor Willy Brandt called democracy a “peculiar holdover with no future.”
But little did Brandt know that just around the corner was a huge push toward
democracy that would find one nation after another adopting their own version
of the Enlightenment form of government.

Democracy is very much the result of Enlightenment thinkers looking for a
better form of government than the reign of terror that had plagued the world
since biblical times. People were tired of slavery, torture, human sacrifices
and the public mutilation of dissidents.

Another thing people wanted to avoid was leadership breakdowns, such as those
that led to the bloody revolutions in China and Mexico in the early twentieth
century.

In this sense, democracy is a way to protect people from both tyranny and
anarchy, and it’s proven to be the one form of government with healthier
economic growth, fewer genocides and better education.

As of 2015, there are 103 democratic nations, a pretty good number, considering
that it fell to 12 during the fascist uprisings of the 1920s.

The shift toward democracy has been a boon to the Enlightenment agenda and,
since it’s allowed the world to become more cosmopolitan, it’s also reduced
racist and sexist attitudes.

Simply put, racism and sexism are untenable arguments, which means they can’t
withstand scrutiny and there’s no rational or reasonable defense of them. In a
more cosmopolitan world, with more travel and more people crossing paths,
people are far more likely to be exposed to enlightened ideas and have their
unenlightened assumptions challenged and refuted.

So it makes sense that the modern world has far fewer ethnic and racial
discriminatory laws on the books. In 1950, half the world’s nations had these
laws, but by 2003, that number was down to under one-fifth. And with the
exception of Vatican City, women can now vote everywhere that men are allowed
to.

## The environment and existential threats can be met with optimistic reason, rather than pessimism and doom.

The daily news offers no shortage of things to freak out about. But if you do
some digging and uncover the real problem, there’s not as much reason to panic
as you think. Case in point: terrorism.

The actions of ISIS and other terrorist organizations are abhorrent, but are
Americans right in thinking that ISIS is an immediate threat to the existence
of the United States? After all, this is what a majority of Americans believed
in a 2016 poll.

The reality is that an American is more likely to be killed by lightning or a
bee sting than a terrorist. If we look at the worldwide statistics, all people
would still be 125 times more likely to die in an accident than at the hands of
a terrorist.

People are afraid because of the negative bias and fearmongering sensationalism
that taint the media’s presentation of world news. The press is fond of
exaggerating the severity of all sorts of existential threats.

It’s not uncommon to read articles about artificial intelligence (AI) that
suggest that we’re moments away from some **Terminator**-like scenario, and
that an AI program will soon begin killing humans because it misinterpreted its
programming directives. Even Elon Musk and Stephen Hawking have been quoted as
saying AI is an all-too-real threat.

But there’s really little reason to conclude that AI’s ability to drive a car
or beat someone at the board game Go means it poses a serious threat to
humanity. In fact, as technology has progressed, it’s also gotten safer, with
more levels of fail-safe monitoring. If something poses any threat, chances are
there’s someone with a switch who’s monitoring the person with the switch who’s
monitoring yet another person and so on.

If people are clever enough to create a groundbreaking AI program, they no
doubt have contingency plans for any problem you can dream up.

## Beware of politics and organizations that attempt to vilify science and reason.

Believe it or not, science doesn’t have an agenda, other than using information
to gain knowledge. It’s not a field that exists with the intent to poke holes
in your religion or belief system. And contrary to what some have suggested,
science isn’t racist, sexist or responsible for the Holocaust.

It might sound absurd, but there’s a long history of science being attacked by
ignorance and misunderstanding, not to mention by people trying to advance
their own agenda. Since science is one of the tenets of the Enlightenment, it’s
important to spot this nincompoopery and see the truth.

A popular claim is that science fueled Hitler’s Nazi agenda, even though Hitler
was expressly anti-science, anti-reason, anti-progress and, therefore,
anti-Enlightenment.

Nevertheless, some people claim that science led to the Holocaust, an argument
that hinges on the Aryan myth, which was invented by Arthur de Gobineau,
promoted by Wagner and embraced by Hitler. According to the myth, the Aryan
race was perfect until it was blighted by other races, an idea that flies in
the face of Darwinism, which argues that all humans have base impulses and that
no group is superior to any other.

People also blame eugenics for Hitler’s actions, even though the eugenics
proposed by Francis Galton, a Victorian statistician and polymath, was limited
to incentivizing talented people to procreate. It had nothing to do with
sterilizing “unfit” people, which is an unscientific proposal that other people
came up with some time later.

These days, attacks on science are likely to be thinly veiled attempts to
discredit a legitimate concern, such as climate change.

One of the greatest challenges facing humanity is cutting back on CO2 emissions
by 50 percent by 2050 and eliminating them completely by 2100. If we don’t do
this, the threat of global temperatures exceeding an additional 2 degrees
Celsius is extremely likely, which will cause permafrost to melt, raise sea
levels and cause all manner of catastrophe. This isn’t some Chinese conspiracy,
as Donald Trump has suggested – this is real science.

## Despite recent upticks in populism, Enlightenment is still the path forward.

While it’s certainly distressing to see Donald Trump, who the author sees as
distinctly anti-Enlightenment, win the US presidency, we can still take some
small comfort in the fact that he lost the popular vote by a significant margin
and has one of the lowest approval ratings of any US president.

Another advantage of democracy is that there are checks and balances in place
to prevent authoritarian demagogues from wreaking too much havoc, and we’ve
already seen the justice system prevent some of his attempts at overstepping
his bounds.

In Europe there has also been a movement of people pushing back against the
values of the Enlightenment, but there are reasons to believe that this too
will pass.

Across Europe, the populist parties, which favor nationalistic, tribalist,
anti-cosmopolitan values, have only managed to get about 13 percent of the
vote, while ultimately losing as many legislative seats as they’ve gained. They
may have gained a foothold in Poland and Hungary, but the numbers show that
these populist voters are old, and not the voice of the future.

While the Brexit vote may have been alarming, only 29 percent of people with a
college education voted in favor of it. In 2016, the “pro-leave” voters
signaled their disapproval of how the world has become more cosmopolitan, but
it’s likely to continue to do so despite their protests.

Younger generations across the globe are polling as more progressive, tolerant
and less religious than the previous generation. According to WIN-Gallup
International’s Global Index of Religiosity and Atheism, even in traditionally
religious countries, like Poland, Turkey and Russia, there was an average
nine-percent decrease in people who identify themselves as religious between
2005 and 2012. So, with each successive generation, we see more people relying
on reason, science and humanism as the source of their values. While religion
needn’t be at odds with Enlightenment, progress can be impeded when people base
their values on the interpretations of sacred texts.

Despite cultural critics’ doom-and-gloom prophecies and the media’s negativity,
the data shows a positive story, a story of the triumph of reason and humanism
over the past 100 years. And there’s no reason to think this progress will be
reversed. In fact, the opinions and polling of today’s youth show them to be
even more in line with the values of the Enlightenment than the people who got
them to where they are today.

**The Mind Club** (2016) is all about how we perceive beings as having a mind
or not, and how this determination affects our moral judgments. These blinks
explain what constitutes a mind as well as how and why we perceive minds the
way we do.
