(2017) explores how and why organizations that focus on employee experience far
outperform those that don’t. Utilizing recent research, it identifies the key
dimensions and features of a workplace that creates an optimal employee
experience. It also provides practical suggestions for how you too can create
such a workplace, which enables employees to feel inspired, motivated and eager
to do their jobs. 

## Final summary

In today’s business world, experiential organizations are far and away the most
successful when measured by almost every metric. The key to their success is
that they provide their employees with optimal physical, technological and
cultural workplace environments. These environments, in turn, are fine-tuned by
infinite design loops, fueled by a focus on teamwork and driven by a strong
sense of purpose, which provides an experiential organization with its reason
for being.

Actionable advice: **Talk to someone at work about your gripes.**

Ask yourself, “If I could bottle up what it’s like to work at my organization
and turn it into pill-form right now, would I swallow it?” If the answer is no,
then ask your colleagues the same question. If they feel the same as you, speak
up and instigate the requisite change. 

## What’s in it for me? Learn how organizations can achieve success by creating an optimal employee experience. 

Have you ever looked at companies like Facebook, Google or Amazon and wondered
how they always attract the best talent? It’s certainly not an accident, and
it’s not just because they throw their money around either.

In these blinks, you’ll find out how to build (or rebuild) your organization
from the ground up, with the cooperation of your employees. You’ll learn how to
create a work environment that nurtures their talent and helps them get the
most out of their jobs. And you’ll be surprised by how even simple changes can
inspire them to reach higher levels of performance, resulting in financial
success.

As we go along, you’ll also learnt:
- why Facebook’s offices are more than just fun-filled working environments;
- why thinking about your organization’s wider impact on the world is crucial
  to its success; and
- how a NASA janitor inspired President Kennedy!

## By focusing on employee experience, you can create a physical workplace environment that truly meets your workers’ needs. 

What if every single one of your organization’s employees arrived at work truly
excited about their jobs? What if they couldn’t wait to get started with their
work each and every day? Some businesses have already figured out how to turn
this dream into a reality. What’s their secret? 

Well, its begins with the realization that focusing on employee** experience**
is very different than focusing on employee** engagement**. 

When seeking to promote employee engagement, companies try to find ways to
better motivate their workers by making them feel more involved in the
workplace. Unfortunately, they often end up simply trotting out the same old
half measures that businesses have been rehashing since the 1980s. 

For example, consider so-called “engagement initiatives.” Many employees have
come into work one morning to find free snacks, a beer fridge or a sporadic
team-building trip thrust upon them. Sure, they’re a great way to make
employees feel better – for about five minutes. But these short-term cosmetic
changes are outdated and wear off quickly.

Focusing on employee experience instead leads to a very different approach. It
involves a more holistic, long-term redesign of your entire organization.
Here’s a useful metaphor for understanding what that means and why it’s
important. Let’s say you’re rebuilding an old car. You can repaint the exterior
and refurbish the interior, but without a new engine, the car’s performance is
exactly the same! 

To improve employee experience, you need to upgrade the engine of your
organization. And what is that engine? Well, it can be split into three main
components: the physical, technological and cultural environments of your
workplace. 

Let’s start with the physical environment. Facebook provides a well-known
example of a company that has enhanced its employee experience by creating
highly attractive, innovatively designed offices. But the social media giant
didn’t build them just because they looked cool on paper. It spent a lot of
time talking with its employees to figure out what they needed, and then it
designed a physical environment to meet their requirements. 

That’s one of the reasons why Facebook has become such a coveted place to work.
By carefully listening to its employees’ expectations, desires and needs, a
company like Facebook becomes an **experiential organization **– an
organization that is truly focused on employee experience. 

In the next blink, we’ll take a closer look at how an experiential organization
can create an optimal physical environment for its employees. Then we’ll look
at the technological and cultural environments. 

## Experiential organizations design physical environments that inspire creativity.

When designing their workplaces, organizations often forget that their physical
environments have to reflect their core values. A failure to remember this fact
can spell disaster when you’re trying to create an optimal employee
experience. 

To see why, imagine you join a company that actively ignores the principles it
claims to care about – like having a lack of recycling bins, despite professing
eco-friendly values. Wouldn’t you feel lied to and betrayed?

Experiential organizations always lead by example. We’ve heard that Facebook
has great offices, but why are they so brilliant? Well, Facebook’s core values
are: “Be bold. Focus on impact. Move fast. Be open. Build social value.” They
have created a physical environment that reflects these values. For instance,
its campus is filled with open floor plans, eclectic art, easily accessible
spaces, a diverse group of employees and regular guest speakers.

And why does Facebook make sure its campus looks and operates this way? Because
they understand that employees perform better when they control how they work. 

In today’s hyper-connected world, work/life balance has been replaced by
work/life integration. Traditional notions like nine-to-five schedules and
fixed workspaces are things of the past. Today, employees expect to be able to
work from anywhere, anytime.

This truth was corroborated by a study conducted by the professional services
firm EY in 2015. They surveyed 10,000 employees around the world and found that
flexibility is almost as important as a competitive salary.

Offices therefore need to be imaginatively redesigned. To do so, organizations
have to forget the simplistic open/closed debate – employees are away from
their desks up to 60 percent of the time anyway. Instead, picture your office
like a house with different spaces for distinct functions, moods and people.
You could have private cubicles, cafes, lounges, co-working spaces, conference
rooms, quiet areas and outside work areas.

Organizations that undertake such radial changes reap equally radical rewards. 

That was highlighted by a report from FlexJobs, a service that allows people to
find flexible work options. They found that when people control when and where
they work, it makes them more productive, healthier, happier and less stressed.
And their organizations enjoy less absenteeism, increased trust and financial
savings.

However, don’t just copy Facebook or Google because they’ve got cool stuff!
Your organization has different employees with different needs, so talk to
them. Design **with** them, not for them.

## Cultivate a technological environment that makes all of your employees’ lives easier. 

Over the last few decades, technology has revolutionized the world of work and
knowing how to use the latest technology to make your employees’ lives easier
is central. Experiential organizations know this.

Consider the radical changes that the San Diego Zoo made when updating its
technological environment. This 100-year-old nonprofit organization moved from
conducting analogue training sessions in classrooms to implementing a free,
flexible online learning system that employees could access anytime, anywhere. 

The zoo also offered interest-free payroll deductions to its employees on their
purchases of computers and tablets. This allowed hundreds of them to afford
these technologies, which then enabled them to gain 24/7 access to the
training. All of this led to better employee performance, as well as the
conservation of natural resources. In the first year alone, the zoo’s human
resources department cut down its paper usage by 100,000 sheets!  

But be careful! It’s pointless to make technology available to everyone if it’s
frustrating to use.

Too often, internal technologies are geared towards IT professionals, resulting
in clunky and confusing interfaces. You should avoid these by investing in
**consumer-grade technology**: tools that are so well designed that ordinary
people would be happy to use them in their personal lives.

Here’s a case in point: the Royal Bank of Scotland, or RBS, recognized that
most of its 100,000 employees used Facebook, so it rolled out Facebook for
Work, the business version of Facebook, which combines next-generation
technology with easy-to-use features. 

If your employees already enjoy using it in their free time, why not let them
use it at work?

But first, you have to talk with your employees to find out what they actually
need. To facilitate this process, you might consider teaming up your IT
specialists with your human resources department. Otherwise, you might end up
wasting money on great technologies that nobody asked for.

## Boost your employees’ motivation by fostering a team-centered, purpose-driven cultural environment. 

The physical and technological environments are simple enough to understand.
After all, you can touch them and see them. But the cultural environment is
more intangible. You feel it on an emotional level. It leaves you with that
pit-in-your-stomach feeling when you don’t want to go to work –  or that thrill
you feel on Monday mornings when you do! Either way, your organization already
has a cultural environment, and it has a huge impact on how your employees feel
about their jobs. That’s why it’s arguably the most important environment to
improve. 

But where to start? 

The answer can be summed up in a single word: **teamwork**. Strive to make all
of your employees feel like they’re part of a valuable team. For example,
Facebook tries to eradicate the idea of the individual altogether. When the
company enjoys a success, it doesn’t highlight any of the particular people who
contributed to the endeavor; instead, it only praises the teams involved. 

There’s plenty of evidence in favor of taking a team-centered approach like
Facebook’s. For example, in an experiment at Stanford University, participants
were challenged to solve a puzzle on their own. Half of them were given clues
that they were working as part of a larger team. The others were told nothing.
The first group worked 48 percent longer and said the puzzle was more
interesting than the second group did. The study’s conclusion? Simply feeling
like they’re part of a team provides people with extra enthusiasm when they’re
completing tasks. 

Another way to boost your employees’ motivation is to help them feel a strong
sense of purpose. To do this, try to actively show them the direct impact of
all the hard work they do. If you then connect this work back to your
organization’s core values, the results can be astounding.

Nowhere is this better demonstrated than at NASA. In 1962, President John F.
Kennedy was being shown around when he saw a janitor carrying a broom. He
introduced himself and asked the man what he was doing. The janitor looked
Kennedy dead in the eye and said, “Well, Mr. President, I’m helping put a man
on the moon.”

Unless you’re working for SpaceX, your organization is probably not trying to
literally land a person on the moon – but what’s the metaphorical moon you’re
aiming for? What’s your organization’s overarching goal? Whatever it is, make
sure all of your employees have a clear understanding of it, so that even the
janitorial staff feel like they’re a part of something great.

## Experiential organizations are better places to work and enjoy greater financial success than their competitors. 

It can take a lot of time and effort to implement the three key environments,
so what’s the upside? Why should you care whether your employees have an
amazing experience at work?

Simple: people value experiences far more than material things. Research
gathered across the Universities of Cornell, Chicago and California found that
when people spend money on experiences, they feel happier over time. In
contrast, when they spend money on physical items, their happiness nosedives in
the long run.

Following in the footsteps of that research, experiential organizations have
figured out how to completely change their employees’ relationship with work.
It’s no longer a physical purchase – their time in exchange for money – but an
investment in a valuable experience. And to make that investment and deliver
that experience, you have to cultivate the physical, technological and cultural
environments of your workplace.

The proof is in the pudding. Experiential organizations consistently perform at
a higher level than their competitors. If you look at a combination of
financial metrics, ranking lists, stock price performance and anecdotal
evidence, you’ll find that experiential organizations consistently score the
highest in customer service, innovation, employer attractiveness, employee
happiness and brand value, to name just a few criteria.

And the net result of all of this? Financial success.  

Data provided by organizations such as Yahoo! Finance, PayScale and Fortune
reveal even more incredible stats. Not only do experiential organizations have
a 40 percent lower employee-turnover rate, but they also bring in more than
double the average revenue and quadruple the average profit! Keep digging and
you’ll find they have almost three times more revenue and over four times more
profit per employee. 

Take a moment to let those figures sink in.

No matter your industry, your people are the key factors that ultimately
separate you from your competition. If people actively want to work in your
organization, you’ll attract the best talent. And if you have the top people,
performing at their peak, then success will follow. 

So what does a great employee experience look like? We’ll look at that in the
next blink. 

## Organizations wanting to create an awesome employee experience must start with a strong reason for being.

Most businesses are familiar with the idea of a mission statement – a formal
summary of the company’s core aims. However, mission statements tend to be a
little vanilla. They typically focus on things like profits, customer
satisfaction and shareholder value. 

For example, one major retailer states it aims “to be a leader in the
distribution and merchandising of food, pharmacy, health and personal care
items, seasonal merchandise, and related products and services.” While that’s a
clear and honest ambition, it’s not exactly going to fill employees with
rousing inspiration. 

Experiential organizations go beyond a bland mission statement to create a more
inspiring **reason for being. **A reason for being needs to focus on the impact
your organization has on its community and the world at large. It shouldn’t
have anything to do with financial gain. Instead, it should rally employees
around a lofty goal that provides them with a calling for which they can
continually strive to work better. Paradoxically, that means it should be an
objective that’s both feasible and unachievable at the same time! 

For example, Salesforce.org’s stated objective is to utilize one percent of all
its resources, including its technology and people, to help improve communities
around the world and encourage other companies to do the same. There’s no
mention of profits, and it’s an ambition that can never be fully realized.
After all, communities always have room for further improvement, and there’s
always more that companies can do to help them. Thus, Saleforce.org’s objective
provides its employees with a compelling reason to stand behind the company and
continually strive to do better work. 

Creating your reason for being is an exciting and foundational part of the
process of becoming an experiential organization. However, as you’re pursuing
it, make sure you seek out your employees’ input. You have to ask them what
they believe your organization stands for and how it makes a difference in the
world.

## Improve your organization’s three key environments by implementing an infinite design loop.

Business changes fast – really fast! And this makes a great employee experience
a moving target. To make sure your organization doesn’t get stuck in
yesteryear, you need to create an **infinite design loop**.

This means you have to listen carefully to your employees. To arrive at
valuable insights, you have to seek out their input and analyze what they have
to say. You can then use these findings to design solutions that can be
launched quickly, so feedback can be gathered almost instantly. In other words,
an infinite design loop is all about actively involving your employees in the
process of improving their organization. 

For example, Airbnb have created a highly successful design loop in an
unlikely-seeming place: a dedicated food team. Airbnb now provide three meals a
day for employees, who provide feedback directly to the food team. To solicit
the employees’ input, the food team sends out an email before every meal with a
menu and a link to a feedback form. When they design a new dish, they fire off
an email to invite all employees to come taste it straight away – first come,
first served!

Thanks to this innovative design loop, 90 percent of employees say the food
program helps to make them more productive, and more than half of them report
that it’s a strong incentive to stay at Airbnb.

Of course, to make a design loop successful, you have to **really** care about
getting to know your people. Anyone can say they want to get in shape and then
go for a run. But if someone really wants to be healthier, they have to make a
long-term commitment to their fitness, and they have exercise on a continual,
ongoing basis. . 

The same holds true for creating a successful design loop. For example, annual
reviews aren’t a bad thing, but they shouldn’t be relied on. When an annual
review is the organization’s only point of contact with its employees, the
design loop is too slow to work. It must be constant.

With that in mind, try to make it super simple for employees to get involved in
the design loop every day. Then provide the teams with the freedom to develop
solutions and the power to launch them quickly.

If you place your workers at the center of the design loop, then they will be
literally creating their own employee experiences. 

## Replace the tired concept of an employee life cycle with the idea of moments that matter. 

The “employee life cycle.” We’ve all heard the term, and we’ve all cringed.
None of us thinks about our work in these terms, but for some reason
organizations do. In truth, employe life cycles couldn’t be further from
reality. 

It’s therefore time to rethink this concept! So how can you design employee
experiences based on how life actually works?

Throw out the concept of life cycles and replace it with the idea of **moments
that matter.** 

A moment that matters is any event that significantly affects your experience
of work. It could be starting the first day of your job, getting promoted,
having a baby, attending a team-building exercise or celebrating a birthday.

There are literally hundreds of possible moments that matter! But the only way
to find the most important moments in your organization is by talking to your
employees. This will have an instant and profound effect – your organization
will begin looking at its employees as human beings, not job machines. 

For example, despite having 70,000 global employees, the technology company
Cisco has found a way to make each of them feel special by identifying 11 key
moments that matter. One of these moments involves giving every employee five
paid days off to volunteer for causes close to their heart. 

Once you’ve found your organization’s moments that matter, they need to be
supported by its three key environments. After all, there’s no point in working
to improve these environments if they don’t feel personalized to each and every
employee. You need to create environments that evolve with your people.

How do you do that? Here’s one idea: on an employee’s first day of work, you
could arrange for them to meet a customer who’s been positively affected by
your organization. It’s an opportunity to showcase your cultural environment
and provide your new team member with a strong sense of purpose. 

Or maybe when an employee is in the middle of moving, you could mould their
Physical Environment around them. You might offer additional flexibility of
working hours and workspace options for example.

But that’s just one possibility. There’s no one-size-fits-all solution. The
only road to success begins with talking to your employees. Ask them which
moments and events have had the biggest impact on their experiences of working
for the company, and take it from there.

## Ensure the employee experience is championed by everyone in your organization.

Who’s in charge of creating an optimal employee experience in your
organization? The simple answer would seem to be, “everyone,” or, “the people
at the top.” However, there’s a more complex, but also more productive way to
think about how the optimization process works. It’s essentially a ripple
effect, which kicks off with your organization’s senior leaders and then
reverberates all the way down its hierarchy.

The process has to be conceived and nurtured by the CEO and executive team.
Ideas can come from anywhere, but they’re the ones who implement the
organization's reason for being, and they must be the biggest ambassadors of
the organization’s core values.

Few leaders do this better than T-Mobile CEO John Legere. He spends weeks on
the road talking to what he calls “the frontline” – employees who interact
directly with customers. He passionately encourages them to complain to his
face so honestly that they would fear getting fired if they were talking to a
normal boss. His mantra is “listen to your frontline, shut up, and do what they
say!” 

Once the executives have rolled out a new employee experience, it has to be
taken to heart by the organization’s various teams. To that end, experiential
organizations have dedicated employee experience roles, which revolve around
steering the optimization process. Airbnb has a chief employee experience
officer, Adobe has an executive vice-president of employee experience, and
Cisco has a chief people officer.

These officers and their teams must then support the individual managers who
drive the optimization process forward. The managers, in turn, have to
encourage their own teams to speak up and not be afraid to complain. 

And the employees themselves must also take responsibility. They have to
constantly provide feedback, ideas and suggestions that might help improve the
organization.

Fostering an optimal employee experience therefore has to be a task that is
championed by everyone. An experiential organization can only see the benefits
if the concept of employee experience is embedded at every level.

If you can achieve this, you’ll find your organization operating more like a
laboratory, rather than a factory. Like a lab, experiential organizations don’t
claim to have all the answers. In fact, they constantly test new ideas and
embrace failure. They experiment every day to gather data and feedback. And
most importantly, they support and encourage their people to do the same.

If your organization can do all of this, then greater success will likely
follow. And beyond the financial rewards, your organization can become a
positive force for change in both the corporate sector and communities around
the world.

Now that you know how to transform your organization’s workplace into an
environment where your employees are eager to do their jobs, there’s just one
task left to accomplish: finding and retaining the most talented people to
staff those jobs.

It’s no use finding those people if you don’t keep them happy, motivated and
satisfied with their work – but it’s also no use keeping them happy, motivated
and satisfied if they aren’t the right people for their positions!
